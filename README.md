# YouTube Channel Analysis ðŸ“Š

Analyzing and Extracting Insights from the Vox YouTube Channel
I have collected data from the YouTube API about my favorite channel Vox and explored the correlation between likes, comments, and views.

## Overview
This project involves the analysis of the Vox YouTube channel using the YouTube Data API. Through custom functions, I collected data on channel information, video details, and comments. The goal was to perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) and predict correlations between comments, likes, and views.

## Project Structure
- `main.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the main code for data extraction and analysis.
- `functions.py`: Python script containing custom functions used in the analysis.
- `README.md`: This file, providing an overview of the project.

## YouTube Data Extraction
### Channel Information
- Extracted key channel information such as name, subscriber count, total views, and video count.

### Video Details
- Retrieved video IDs from the channel's upload playlist.
- Gathered information on each video, including title, published date, description, tags, duration, and statistics.

### Comments
- Collected comments for each video, associating them with the respective video ID.

## EDA and Correlation Analysis
- Explored patterns in the data through EDA.
- Analyzed correlations between comments, likes, and views.

## How to Use
1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repository.git`
2. Install required packages: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Open and run `main.ipynb` in a Jupyter Notebook environment.

## Results
- Visualizations and findings from the EDA and correlation analysis.

## Future Improvements
- Potential enhancements or additional analyses for the project.

## Contributors
- Your Name
- Any collaborators or contributors to the project.
