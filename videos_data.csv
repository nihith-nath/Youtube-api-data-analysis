When credit scores were invented just a few decades ago, they were hailed as a way to democratize lending. Today, they’ve become so essential that not having one can essentially lock you out of daily life. Having a low score can make life challenging, too. 

These scores have a long history — and a lot of problems. In this video, we’ll show you where they came from, how they’ve changed over the years, and actually explain what that three-digit number means for you.

bEJ0_TVXh-I,Vox,UCLXo7UDZvByw2ixzpQCufnA,AI can do your homework. Now what?,2023-12-12 13:00:22+00:00,"We interviewed students and teachers on how schools should handle the rise of the chatbots.

Subscribe to our channel! http://goo.gl/0bsAjO

For a year now, students have had access to AI chatbots, otherwise known as Large Language Models, that can write at a high-school level and answer specific and diverse questions related to many school subjects. OpenAI's ChatGPT kicked off a race among tech companies to release their own chatbots and integrate them into existing consumer products. 

The most advanced language models, like GPT-4 and Claude2 are kept behind paywalls. They offer more nuanced answers and make fewer mistakes but because reliability is not guaranteed, many businesses cannot yet deploy these systems. That means a significant portion of chatbot use cases are for low-stakes applications, like school work. 

This presents a major challenge to educators, who now need to rethink their curriculum to either incorporate chatbot use or to attempt to deter it. In this video, we hear from students and teachers about how they're thinking through the problem, and review research in the science of learning to understand how the ""fluency"" of a chatbot experience could disrupt the learning process that we go to school for.

Subscribe to our channel! http://goo.gl/0bsAjO

Israel has been engaged in harrowing negotiations to recover the roughly 240 hostages held by Hamas and other militant groups in Gaza following the October 7 attack. In exchange for their release, the Israeli government has  a bargaining chip that is extremely valuable to Palestinians: the thousands of Palestinian prisoners locked up in Israeli prisons. 

Each one of these Palestinian prisoners has been processed by Israel’s military court system, which exists completely separate from the civilian court system that Jewish Israelis interact with. This system and the military orders that govern it have their origins in the Israeli occupation of the Palestinian territories in 1967.

In this video, two experts explain Israel’s military court system, why it’s been a focus of outcry from human rights organizations and why hostage negotiations have historically involved the exchange of Palestinian prisoners. 

Vox policy correspondent Abdallah Fayyad wrote about Israel’s military court system for Vox’s site:

Homeownership in the US is basically synonymous with the idea of the American Dream. Owning your own home, the story goes, confers both self-determination and security — instead of paying a landlord, you own a growing asset that will form the base of your wealth. Homeownership is ingrained in US society; the majority of American adults are homeowners.

But somewhere along the line, something changed. Homeownership has been way less accessible to millennials and gen Z than it was to their parents, in part because of dwindling housing supply. But even within that generational disparity, 2023 was a uniquely bad year to try to become a new homeowner. Watch the video above to see exactly how bad, and why.

Subscribe to our channel! http://goo.gl/0bsAjO

Right in the center of the island nation of Madagascar there’s a strange, almost perfectly circular geological structure. It covers a bigger area than the city of Paris — and at first glance, it looks completely empty. But right in the center of that structure, there’s a single, isolated village: a few dozen houses, some fields of crops, and dirt roads stretching out in every direction. 

When we first saw this village on Google Earth, its extreme remoteness fascinated us. Was the village full of people? How did they wind up there? And what did life look like in such a strange geography? To find out, we teamed up with a local team in Madagascar and fell down a rabbit hole of geology and mapping along the way. It’s a story of how continental shifts and volcanic geology came together to form a place for a group of people to call home. 

We got to talk with a lot of experts along the way to make this piece. Here are links to some of their work:

Here is some of Michel Jébrak’s research on the Richat structure: https://www.researchgate.net/publication/32048440_Resolving_the_Richat_enigma_Doming_and_hydrothermal_karstification_above_an_alkaline_complex

Norman Thomas Uphoff at Cornell’s SRI International Network also shared more about agricultural systems and innovation: http://sri.ciifad.cornell.edu/

Correction: At 2:52, we mistakenly labeled Lucienne Wilmé as a professor of geology at the University of Florida. In fact, she is a national coordinator of the Madagascar Program at the World Resources Institute.

Today’s game shows, whether they’re Mr. Beast on YouTube or Storage Wars on cable, often feature sensationalistic editing, recreations, and straight-up fixing. But it wasn’t always that way. As the above video shows, game shows in America have gone from unregulated, to a Federally regulated activity, and back to unregulated once again.

The Quiz Show scandals of the 1950s set in motion a new law that enforced rules for games of skill. But, as the above video shows, changing media consumption habits and expectations have made game shows a wild west once again.

Xi Jinping, president of China and general secretary of the Chinese Communist Party since 2012, is one of the most powerful political figures in the world. By initiating an unprecedented third term as China’s leader in October, 2022, Xi has signaled that he may plan to remain in power for life – making him the first Chinese leader since Mao Zedong to hold unchecked power over the People’s Republic of China. 

But Xi’s connection to Mao goes deeper than a shared outlook that emphasizes unifying the party around a single leader. When Xi was just a young boy, his family – who had held elite party status thanks to his father’s pivotal role in Mao's “Long March” in 1935 – was denounced during Mao’s Cultural Revolution, a chaotic decade of purges and persecution that saw even Mao’s closest allies removed from power. During this time, a teenaged Xi was forced to work hard labor in the countryside outside of Beijing, and his father was imprisoned. 

Xi’s subsequent rise after Mao died in 1976 was a methodical process in using his restored elite status as leverage to gain prominent party positions in rural provinces around China, culminating in his promotion to the all-powerful Politburo Standing Committee of the Chinese Communist Party in 2007.

From there, Xi pulled from Mao’s playbook: purging his political rivals and promoting those with whom he shared close personal ties. This process undid the work of Mao’s successor, Deng Xiaoping, to prevent the consolidation of power around a single leader in China. 

By the time his third term began in October 2022, Xi had reshaped the party and Chinese military leadership to be fully packed with Xi loyalists. And even in the face of social upheaval surrounding his failed Zero Covid policy, Xi has shown no sign of giving up any of the power he has consolidated since taking over as leader of the country.

Bats get a bad rap in all forms of media — and it’s not entirely unwarranted. Whenever they hit the news, it’s typically paired with some deadly disease that they’ve somehow unleashed on humans: from Ebola to Hendra virus to Nipah virus to various coronaviruses such as SARS, MERS, and even Covid-19. Bats are just really good at hosting deadly diseases, so much so that researchers around the globe from Brazil to Australia to China are searching bat genomes for clues about the next potential outbreak. 

But there’s another angle to consider.

Bats aren’t just very good at hosting deadly diseases. They seem to tolerate them very well. After all, we’re not finding caves full of dead bats that were struck down by Ebola or coronavirus. Exactly how they do this has been a mystery, but researchers think it might be because they evolved with a unique ability — they’re the only mammals who can fly. 

When we stop looking at bats as simply reservoirs of deadly disease and start to look at them as the biological marvels they are, new doors open. Ones that could potentially unlock new approaches to how we treat disease in humans.

Physicists have a pretty good handle on how stuff behaves on the surface of the Earth. But a lot of matter in the universe exists outside this narrow band of relatively low temperatures and pressures. Inside planets and stars, the crushing force of gravity begins to overwhelm the electromagnetic and nuclear forces that keep atoms apart and maintain the shapes of molecules. 

What happens next? Scientists (including a consortia of researchers at the NSF’s Center for Matter at Atomic Pressures​​) are just starting to figure that out. They use a variety of tools (including some humongous lasers) to simulate planetary cores and see what happens. A few standout findings so far:

Water can become a hot black ice that conducts electricity: https://www.quantamagazine.org/black-hot-superionic-ice-may-be-natures-most-common-form-of-water-20190508/

Hydrogen gas can be compressed down into a shiny metal: https://www.newscientist.com/article/2119442-metallic-hydrogen-finally-made-in-lab-at-mind-boggling-pressure/

Sodium (a soft, silvery metal at atmospheric pressure) can turn transparent: https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2009/03/090312180838.htm

When you look at college campuses across the US, you’ll see massive concrete buildings everywhere. Many of these are designed in a style of architecture called ""brutalism,"" and it's as divisive as it is distinctive.

Brutalist buildings strive for honesty and transparency in their form and materials. This often means using simple materials like raw untreated concrete as well as using bold geometry. 

Its origins can be traced back to the architect Le Corbusier, who pioneered many of the concepts that would become popular amongst brutalist architects.

Brutalism found its way onto college campuses in the wake of World War II. With veterans returning from the war and a baby boom in the US, campuses expanded their facilities to accommodate the growing enrollment. And they wanted to convey their ambition and progressiveness by utilizing these modernist styles.

But as is explored in the video above, these buildings weren't always popular with the public. And they became less so as time went on. We look at Evans Hall at UC Berkeley, which some people view as the ugliest building on campus and whose future hangs in the balance of shifting tastes in architecture. So what does the future hold for these buildings?

There are film franchises, and then there are shared universes.

Halloween, Scream, The Exorcist are all successful horror franchises. For the most part, they follow one continuous story. Their sequels, re-quels, and reboots all tend to center around the same villain we’ve known since the beginning.

But The Conjuring is different. Every new film pulls on threads from real-life hauntings , creating a wider universe — much like the Marvel Cinematic universe. Except instead of building out its roster of heroes, The Conjuring builds out a roster of villains. 

The Conjurings universe is based on the case files of two of the most famous paranormal investigators of all time: Ed and Lorraine Warren. Whether or not their stories were 100% true is debatable, but one thing is clear: They make for great entertainment.

Their case files have been used as the basis for horror films since the ‘70s, but they really gained traction in 2013 with The Conjuring.

In the 10 years since, the Conjuring has become the highest-grossing horror franchise of all time.

On October 7, Hamas, a militant group based in the Gaza Strip, launched a deadly attack on Israel, killing over 1,400 Israelis and kidnapping over 200. In retaliation, Israeli airstrikes have killed, as of this video, over 6,400 Palestinians in Gaza, where Palestinians have lived for decades under an occupation and blockade. 

Since 1967, Israel has imposed tight restrictions on travel and essential goods such as food, fuel, medicine, and water in its occupied territories. In 2007, those restrictions became even tighter in Gaza after Hamas seized power there. Since then, it has been nearly impossible for Palestinians to leave Gaza or to access an adequate supply of essential goods.

Today, the Gaza Strip, with a population of over 2 million Palestinians, is a victim of what many call “collective punishment” as Israel bombards its population, shuts off access to internet, power, food, water, and medicine, forces them to leave their homes, and prepares for a ground invasion.

This latest episode of Vox Atlas explains how the experience of Palestinians in Gaza got to this point, and what’s behind Israel’s occupation and its blockade of Gaza.

Thank you for watching! We know we couldn’t cover everything about the Gaza Strip, this was just a start. Below are a couple of sources and readings you might find helpful to learn more.

From rising sea levels in Mumbai to unbearable heat in Houston, cities around the world are feeling the effects of climate change. Unfortunately, they don’t always have the right infrastructure to handle its impacts — which is one reason why cities are beginning to reimagine urban design. One of these designs is a “sponge city.”

Although one city design certainly won’t save us from the effects of climate change, “sponge cities” can help with how we live with it.

There are around 1.5 billion cows on the planet being raised as livestock for things like meat and dairy — and they’re a climate problem we’ve struggled to solve. Cows have a specialized digestive tract that allows them to digest tough plant material like grass or hay, but in that process, methane is produced as waste, and the cows ... burp it out. Methane is a greenhouse gas that’s nearly 25 times more potent than carbon dioxide. According to the Environmental Protection Agency, these burping animals are considered one of the largest sources of methane production in the United States, making up nearly 25 percent of all methane emissions. 

You’ve likely heard of a few solutions to this. The loudest one is probably the campaign to get people to cut their beef intake or switch to meat alternatives. It’s an important solution, but people are often reluctant to do it. So instead, some scientists are taking the attention off humans and focusing on the diet of the cows. What they’ve found is that certain additives in cow feed can help reduce methane emissions, and recent work has drawn a lot of attention to one unexpected hero: seaweed.

In the early hours of Saturday, October 7, Israelis living near the border with Gaza awoke to the sounds of Hamas fighters killing and kidnapping their neighbors. As the hours stretched on and they hid, terrified, their frantic text messages contained versions of this question: Where is the army?

To answer that question, we need to travel to the West Bank. 

Watch this video to better understand how Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s obsessive focus on the West Bank has left Israelis everywhere vulnerable.

There are metallic deposits scattered throughout our ocean floors — among hydrothermal vents, under the crust of seamounts, and scattered along sea plains in the form of rocks. As it happens, in our search for climate solutions, these metals have become more critical than ever to help us transition away from fossil fuels. We need them for everything like electric car batteries, copper wiring for electrification and wind turbines.  Our land-based deposits have met our needs so far, but it’s unclear whether they will continue to, or whether we’ll want to keep destroying the environment to do so. 

This video explains the history and the debate over mining metals in the deep sea and why one Canadian company, The Metals Company, is leading the rush there. There are huge environmental implications for digging up seafloor ecosystems as well as ethical ones: Metal-rich zones like the Clarion-Clipperton Zone lie in international waters that technically belong to everyone. A United Nations body located in Kingston, Jamaica, the International Seabed Authority, is faced with an urgent dilemma over how to regulate mining, whether the environmental harm is worth the benefits to solving our climate crisis, and how to fairly share the profits from this shared resource. 

Correction: at 7:45, the company rang the opening bell at Nasdaq not New York Stock Exchange.

You can dig into the exploration contracts issued by the International Seabed Authority here: 
https://www.isa.org.jm/exploration-contracts/

The New York Times has done some important investigative work on deep sea mining: 
https://www.nytimes.com/2022/08/29/world/deep-sea-mining.html

This study provides a thorough overview of some of the ecosystems with metallic deposits:

If you’ve taken an over-the-counter decongestant in the past 20 years, you’ve probably taken something with phenylephrine as the main active ingredient. A Food and Drug Administration panel recently recommended that it be taken off shelves because it doesn’t work any better than a placebo. What happened?

In the above video, Vox’s Phil Edwards chronicles the history of the FDA’s regulation of over-the-counter medicines. That process is the reason that, despite decades of evidence that phenylephrine doesn’t work (especially in typical OTC doses), it’s remained an option for consumers.

Watch the above video to learn more.

In the 1960s, Floyd B. McKissick, a prolific civil rights activist, embarked on an ambitious idea: What if Black Americans could build and lead their own city? A place centered on the idea of racial equality and economic power, where everyone, especially people of color and the poor, could thrive? That idea turned into Soul City, North Carolina: the Black-led, capitalist utopia that almost came to be.

At the time, the federal government was encouraging the idea of new cities. The US Department of Housing and Urban Development opened up a process to finance new towns built by private developers. McKissick took the opportunity to pitch his idea and hoped to secure federal funding to finally make his dream a reality. But to do it, he also made an unlikely ally: Republican President  Richard Nixon. By 1972, Soul City was approved for funding, and McKissick broke ground on hundreds of acres of former tobacco plantation land in Warren County, North Carolina.

Designs were drafted. Land was cleared. An electrical grid and water system were constructed. Infrastructure was built, like roads, a public pool, a health clinic, and a massive industrial building called “Soul Tech One” — meant to be a manufacturing hub. But within just seven years of breaking ground, McKissick’s dream of Soul City was cut short. In the piece above, we explore what happened to this experimental town. With the help of McKissick’s son, former Sen. Floyd McKissick Jr.,  and one of Soul City’s first residents, Jane Ball-Groom, we look at what got built, what remains today, and the forces that came together to cause its end.

The summer of 2023 was the summer of Barbie.  Everywhere you looked there was marketing — posters, ads, trailers. There were Barbie cafe’s, Barbie progressive commercials, everyone was wearing pink! It was a delightful wave of cinematic energy.

But it was also completely overwhelming. At times it felt inescapable. 

Barbie’s marketing felt different. And in some ways it was — but it owes a lot to the blockbusters that came before. 

As promised, here are the links:

In 2021, President Biden set an ambitious climate goal for the US to reach net-zero carbon emissions economy-wide by 2050. And as part of the transition to renewable energy, the country has drastically ramped up production of solar over the past few years. But that’s led to a new problem: finding enough land on which to put solar panels. 

The easiest and cheapest places to install solar panels are often large, undeveloped plots of land. It's why, in many places across the country, we've seen rural areas — including fragile desert ecosystems and valuable farmland — turned into solar farms. Many local residents and conservationists have protested these rural solar projects for a variety of reasons: Some want to keep natural views, others want to retain space for agriculture or aim to preserve biodiversity. Solar will likely play an important role in the country’s move away from fossil fuels — but is there a smarter way to do it that doesn’t require taking up so much rural land?

In the video above, we explore one option that could help: parking lots. Solar photovoltaics researcher and professor Joshua Pearce goes into the data on how placing solar canopies over parking lots could be a worthwhile investment for many cities. And as more countries, like France, are moving toward retrofitting parking spaces with solar, we look at what it could mean in the US.

Remember during lockdown, how we all got obsessed with ordering everything online and having it delivered right to our doorsteps? Yeah, turns out that isn’t going away anytime soon, and we’re starting to understand the many downsides. The delivery vans that make our next-day shipping dreams come true are driving up C02 emissions while making our streets more crowded and less safe.

Fortunately, there’s a hero waiting in the wings: the e-cargo bike. Not only can these bad boys deliver packages in urban environments just as quickly (and sometimes faster) than delivery vans, they take up far less space and are much less likely to cause pedestrian deaths. Companies like Amazon, DHL, and UPS are using them in several European cities, but American cities haven’t followed suit. 

In this video, we explore why that is, and lay out some of the big steps American cities would need to take to join the e-bike delivery revolution.

Vox is on a mission is to help everyone, regardless of income or status, understand our complicated world so that we can all help shape it.

In 2022, before he began a campaign for the presidency, Ron DeSantis was reelected governor of Florida in a landslide. This was impressive and surprising because the 2022 elections were disappointing for Republicans almost everywhere else in the US. But DeSantis’s overwhelming victory was doubly impressive and surprising because when he had first been elected, just four years earlier, it was by just a tiny margin.

For a long time, in fact, tiny election margins were the norm in Florida elections. Florida was a “swing state” — it sometimes voted for Democrats, sometimes for Republicans, and was a major prize up for grabs in presidential elections. But by 2022, something had changed: Florida Republicans up and down the ballot won their races by margins similar to DeSantis’s, and no one was calling Florida a swing state anymore.

Florida seems to have undergone a political transformation. So what happened? In this video, we look at three possible explanations.

Chapters: 
0:00 What changed?
1:49 Defining the question
2:52 New Floridians
4:10 Latino voters
7:05 Florida Democrats
8:26 The other reasons
10:09 A request

Read “The United States of Florida,” a contributor-supported project from Vox: https://www.vox.com/culture/23864468/florida-man-invasive-species-republican-disney-publix-miami

We looked at …. a lot of data for this video. Here are the main sources we used:

County-by-county results in Florida elections from 2016-2022 came from the Florida Department of State’s Election Reporting System: https://results.elections.myflorida.com/

The screenshotted US Census page showing that Miami-Dade is mostly Latino can be found here, under the “data tables” tab: https://www.census.gov/library/visualizations/interactive/racial-and-ethnic-diversity-in-the-united-states-2010-and-2020-census.html

Our map showing the “specific origin” of various states’ Latino populations was inspired by the University of Washington’s Great Migrations Project: https://depts.washington.edu/moving1/map_latinx_migration.shtml

The data we used for that map came from the US Census via this very helpful tool: https://data.census.gov/table?q=B03001:+HISPANIC+OR+LATINO+ORIGIN+BY+SPECIFIC+ORIGIN

The chart about Spanish-language ad spending in the 2022 Florida governor’s race came from a post-mortem of the 2022 election by the research firm Equis. You can find it on page 59: https://weareequis.us/api/docs/qV8T7OpIWxw54fYWr9F0M/d1ecc7309b286d6b7db60d7f140f3b4f/2022_Post-Mortem_June_14.pdf

And now for the big red bars. The Florida state party expenditures came from Transparency USA, an organization that tracks state-level campaign finance data. That data for Florida Republicans is here: https://www.transparencyusa.org/fl/committee/republican-party-of-florida-4700-pty
And Democratic state party expenditures are here: https://www.transparencyusa.org/fl/committee/florida-democratic-party-1539-pty

The data on the best-funded state parties is from OpenSecrets, another org that tracks campaign finance data: https://www.opensecrets.org/political-parties/top-committees?cycle=2022&party=A&type=R

The chart at the end, which compiles spending from the national Democratic Party, was also based on information from OpenSecrets: https://www.opensecrets.org/political-parties

And the data on how much the state parties raised came from Florida Department of State’s campaign finance database: https://dos.elections.myflorida.com/campaign-finance/contributions/

The line chart that shows total voter registrations for each party is based on data that Florida’s Division of Elections makes public: https://dos.myflorida.com/elections/data-statistics/voter-registration-statistics/voter-registration-reports/voter-registration-by-party-affiliation/

Finally, the data around voters who moved to a new state and new Florida registrations from 2020-2023 came from the data vendor L2: https://www.l2datamapping.com/

During the US Open in New York, Vox video sat down with professional tennis players and the head of the Professional Tennis Players Association to explain the pay problem in the top-five global sport. Tennis is unique among other professional sports in how players are paid, what costs they are responsible for, and how they are categorized as independent contractors. The result is that — unless you are consistently among the very top-ranked players like Rafael Nadal, Andy Murray, Roger Federer, Serena Williams, and Naomi Osaka — it’s nearly impossible to make a living with income from tennis alone. 

Unlike other sports that provide support for people outside the very top performers, tennis leaves them high and dry. 

In 2021, Novak Djokovic and Vasek Pospisil co-founded a players organization in part to try to address these issues they believe pose an existential threat to the sport. It’s called the Professional Tennis Players Association, and Vox video worked with it to interview players and the organization’s president to shed light on the structural issues that cause such a pay disparity when compared with other global sports.

Iceland has made significant progress with its gender pay gap in the past 50 years. In 1975, Icelandic women made around 40 percent less than what men made. Today, that number is around 10 percent, making Iceland one of the few countries in the world where women are paid almost as much as men.

To understand how Iceland made so much progress, you have to take a look at what happened almost 50 years ago. In 1970, a radical feminist group called the Redstockings formed in response to outdated ideas in Iceland surrounding issues like violence against women, reproductive rights, and women’s labor. The Redstockings were known for their loud and public demonstrations, and in 1975 they proposed their biggest idea yet: a women’s strike. A day when women would collectively refuse to work at home and in the office to prove their economic worth to society.

The idea was divisive at first, but slowly, women from different political backgrounds got on board. To make the idea more accessible, they changed the name to “Women’s Day Off,” or “Kvennafrí,” and planned the strike from the ground up. It was a massive success. An estimated 90 percent of Icelandic women refused to work that day, and it shut down the country. Flights were canceled without flight attendants, and schools were closed without teachers. Men had to bring children to work because there was no child care at home.

The effects of Kvennafrí were felt across the country. Iceland quickly passed its first Gender Equality Act and soon after elected its first female president — and the world's first woman to be elected democratically. In this episode of Missing Chapter, we walk through how Icelandic women shut down their country, and talk to one of the women who helped do it.

Subscribe and turn on notifications 🔔 so you don't miss any videos: http://goo.gl/0bsAjO

Every year there are alarming headlines about honeybees in the US. Each one highlights some grim facts about the fate of these insects and the subsequent fallout: Colonies are collapsing, beekeepers are struggling, and farming is at risk. The stakes are high. Honeybees are estimated to pollinate up to $15 billion worth of food in the US. It’s safe to say that without them our plates and farms would look very different. Naturally, they’ve become the face of a larger movement to “save the bees,” but the truth is … they’ll be fine. 

Honeybees are domesticated animals being cared for by a billion-dollar agriculture industry. They’re so ingrained into American life that it might surprise you that they’re not even from the US — they were brought here by settlers in the 1600s. We give them a ton of attention, and the species as a whole isn’t threatened or even at risk — but other species are.

There are 20,000 other species of bees in the world — over 4,000 in the United States. They’re incredibly diverse, unique, and also important for pollination. Unfortunately, hundreds of these bee species are at risk of being lost forever, but you rarely see those headlines. Watch the video above to learn more.

When you’re flying, there’s one thing you want to be above all else — comfortable. (Well, besides safe, of course!) 

Whether or not you’re comfortable is determined by a slew of factors, but none draw more ire than seat pitch — the fancy term used to describe the distance between where your seat begins and the seat in front of you ends. You probably know it as legroom. 

Legroom is a precious commodity, and airlines are aware of this. After all, there is a finite amount of space on planes. In order to get the maximum number of people onboard, you have to either innovate — like by designing slimmer seats — or you have to shrink the seat pitch. Airlines have done both. Plus, they now give you the option to spend some more money to upgrade for more legroom, allowing you (and your wallet) to choose how comfortable you want to be. 

If you want the cheapest flight, then you have to be willing to endure the slimmest seat pitch. If you’re willing and able to pay more, then you can feel the comfort of yesteryear, when seat pitch was way more luxurious.

Though there have been legal efforts to come up with minimum seat dimensions, there are no current regulations on seat pitch. For now, it’s still up to airlines to decide their own minimums, while hopefully enticing you to upgrade. Check out Vox video team's latest to learn more!

Subscribe and turn on notifications 🔔  so you don't miss any videos: http://goo.gl/0bsAjO 

Cruise ships are freaking big. They’re the biggest passenger vessels humans have ever built. In size and appearance, they look nothing like almost any other boat. So how did they get that way?

The predecessor of today’s cruise ships was the ocean liner: big, beautiful ships that sailed across the Atlantic. But ocean liners had a totally different purpose from cruise ships: They were for transportation. Everything about them was designed to facilitate an ocean voyage from one continent to another.

But air travel changed that. Planes eliminated the main reason to take a ship somewhere, and ocean liner business plummeted. So the industry pivoted and began selling a ship as the destination itself. The cruise ship was born. But the ocean liners, built for a voyage, weren’t ideal for the purposes of a cruise, and over the next few decades, the cruise ship began its evolution. And it has culminated in the behemoths we see today.

In 2016, a Supreme Court case in Canada removed the criminal penalties for doctors providing a patient with a medically assisted death. Since then, the country has been embroiled in a legal and ethical debate about where to draw the line on who qualifies for one. 

In the US states where it's legal, that line is drawn at a terminal diagnosis with 6 months to live. On the other end of the spectrum, countries like Belgium, Luxembourg, and the Netherlands allow anyone suffering from a serious condition to qualify, so long as they’ve exhausted treatments available to them.

After a series of court cases, Canada has landed somewhere closer to where the Benelux countries are: there is no terminal diagnosis requirement, and next year, people whose only serious condition is a mental illness will qualify for an assisted death. 

While the Canadian public appears to show large support for the policy change, there are vocal minorities who believe that it is dangerous. Many in the disability rights community believe that making a disability an eligible condition for assisted death is discriminatory. Some psychiatrists and mental health practitioners are concerned about when you can decide a mental illness is eligible — and that it could hinder the work of suicide prevention. 

This is the debate we present here. Dr. Stefanie Green is a practitioner of medically assisted dying (MAID) in British Columbia and is the co-founder and president of the Canadian Association of MAID Assessors and Providers (CAMAP). She also wrote a book about her work as a MAID practitioner, called This is Assisted Dying. She argues that Canada’s policies have been successful and have been extremely meaningful for her patients. 

Dr. John Maher is a psychiatrist based in Ontario who leads an Assertive Community Treatment group and is the editor-in-chief of the Journal of Ethics in Mental Health. He argues that there aren’t enough safeguards in place in Canada and that offering the option of euthanasia to people with mental health will undermine the suicide prevention work he does. 

In Vox Video’s take on a debate, we asked both participants to identify facts that their opponent would have to concede are true. They were given an opportunity to review each other’s facts in advance and, in a video call, agreed on a set of six. In the video, you’ll see those facts presented, with each participant given the opportunity to add a “footnote” to their opponent’s facts. We added four additional rounds to our format to give our participants more time to flesh out their viewpoints. 

Here's a document that has all of the sources we used for each fact:

It’s no secret that big cars dominate American roads. But even so, some of the stats are staggering: Last year, 80 percent of all new cars sold in the US were SUVs and trucks. That’s compared to just 52 percent in 2011. Meanwhile, many automakers are phasing out passenger cars as consumer demand for them has disappeared. 

Not all of this is a result of consumer choice, though. A huge factor in why SUVs and trucks are so popular in the US is hidden in a 50-year-old policy decision. In this video we cover the history of the SUV, and how its origin story and popularity is rooted in US fuel economy standards.

Subscribe and turn on notifications 🔔 so you don't miss any videos: http://goo.gl/0bsAjO 

Los Alamos quickly became the centerpiece of the Manhattan Project — the United States’ successful attempt to develop a nuclear bomb. But why was Los Alamos selected, and how did that relate to the selection of the subsequent testing site? The above video tells the story of Oppenheimer’s selection of the site and the unique culture that was built there.

Los Alamos was more than a lab — it was a secret city, built for the express purpose of atomic development. Housing top scientists, their families, and support staff, this island of research led to a century-changing technological development.

If you’ve taken the Amtrak recently, you might have no idea that the United States used to have the largest and wealthiest rail system in the world. How did the US go from having luxurious, widely used passenger trains to the Amtrak system we have today? 

Video producer Dean Peterson makes a 72-hour journey on Amtrak from LA to NYC to show its current state of operation. From getting kicked in the head by his sleeping seat mate to taking in sweeping views of the desert at sunset, Dean shows the highs and lows of being stuck on Amtrak for days on end. 

Along the way, he explains the history of passenger rail in the US — starting in the problematic robber baron era to the US government’s takeover of passenger rail. Will the United States ever catch up to the rest of the world when it comes to train travel, or are Americans stuck with an underfunded, inefficient rail network forever? Join Dean on his journey as he sets out to find out the answer to these questions and more.

Subscribe and turn on notifications 🔔 so you don't miss any videos: http://goo.gl/0bsAjO 

Baseball has a long history in the United States, but it also has strong roots in the Caribbean and Latin America, particularly in the Dominican Republic. Cubans were the first to bring the game from the US to their country in the 19th century, and later, wealthy Cubans introduced it to the Dominican Republic. Over the following decades, the sport became deeply ingrained in Dominican culture, while in the United States, baseball evolved into a multi-million dollar industry. 

Eventually, the United States began to seek out Cuban baseball talent. But when diplomatic relations between the two countries deteriorated, the Dominican Republic emerged as the primary focus of Major League Baseball's talent pipeline.

As Dominicans demonstrated their skill and success as baseball players, the MLB started establishing academies in the Dominican Republic, which were affiliated with MLB teams in the United States. This system facilitated the influx of numerous talented Dominican players into MLB teams. Currently, Dominicans dominate Major League Baseball in the United States, making up more than 10 percent of all players in the league. They significantly outnumber players from other foreign-born countries.

To gain a deeper understanding of how baseball spread throughout the Dominican Republic and why the island produces so many MLB players, watch the latest episode of Vox Atlas.

You’ve seen it on the highway: a giant RV, lumbering by with its exterior totally covered in swooshes and swoops. Those lines of paint seem to grace the sides of every recreational vehicle, and for decades they’ve defined the RV aesthetic. But where did they come from?

In this video, producer Estelle Caswell heads to Elkhart, Indiana — the global capital of RV production — to investigate why these swoops are everywhere, and whether they’re here to stay. While there, she explores Elkhart’s RV history museum and library and speaks to RV designers who love and hate the swoops.   

Will RV makers be forced to change their infamous look to appeal to younger generations obsessed with clean aesthetics? Or are we stuck with this look for the next 20 years? Check out the video to find out. 

Note: The headline on this piece has been updated.

Subscribe and turn on notifications 🔔  so you don't miss any videos: http://goo.gl/0bsAjO 

When flight attendants, known as stewardesses at the time, first took flight in the 1930s, the profession became a token of glamor. Unlike other jobs open to women at the time, like teaching or secretarial work, stewardesses had a unique opportunity to travel the world and meet new people thousands of feet in the air. While the position provided exciting opportunities for working women, it also capitalized on the bodies of these women to benefit the airline industry.

For decades, airlines exclusively hired young, single, unmarried, white women and enforced strict policies — like weight and age requirements —  to make sure their employees were up to the standard they were selling. Airlines relied on the glamorous reputation of the jet-setting stewardess to sell luxury air travel, and it worked. Along with imposing extreme qualifications for the job, airlines leaned into a “sexy stewardess” stereotype with advertising campaigns and new uniforms, like Southwest Airlines' “hot pants” that painted stewardesses as sex objects. 

But in the 1960s and '70s, stewardesses mounted an organized push against their employers' discriminatory labor practices. They became one of the first groups in the US to fight discrimination in the workplace. And they won. Their activism and legal battles, which used Title VII of the Civil Rights Act,  became known as the “stewardess rebellion.” It changed the airline industry into what we know today and paved the way for working women nationwide.

Out of the millions of fungal species in the world, only a few hundred can make people sick. Coccidioides is one of them — and it lives in desert dust. Microscopic spores are kicked up when the ground is disturbed; if inhaled, they can cause an infection known as Valley fever. Most people recover without ever knowing they had it, but others will experience far more intense symptoms, ranging from pneumonia to meningitis. Coccidioides is also really good at eating … meat. 

Fortunately, this fungus is typically only found in the southwestern US, parts of Mexico, and Central and South America — and cases are rare. But unfortunately, that range is expanding quickly. Scientists are racing to understand exactly why, because even though this fungus has existed for millennia, there are still tons of unanswered questions about how it lives both in the desert and in people.

Subscribe and turn on notifications 🔔 so you don't miss any videos: http://goo.gl/0bsAjO 

Miniatures in movies are way more common than you may realize, and one of the most stylish filmmakers keeping them alive is Wes Anderson. In this video we spoke to Simon Weisse, prop maker and model marker for some of Wes Anderson’s recent projects, like The Grand Budapest Hotel, The French Dispatch, and Asteroid City.

Older movies, like 1977’s Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope, had no choice but to use miniatures to make their worlds feel real. But even in the modern day of CGI, filmmakers are still using minis — just look at projects like The Mandalorian, Blade Runner 2049, Harry Potter, and The Dark Knight series. In those movies, miniatures are used for expansive sets that establish the world of a film, otherworldly vehicles like spaceships, and more.

But fully fabricating a 1/18th scale hotel is just the beginning. Then filmmakers have to film it in a way where it looks huge, or, at least, life-size — using the movie magic of cameras, lighting, and forced perspective.

On May 3rd, 2023, Serbia experienced two mass shootings that left more than 15 people dead. While Serbia has one of the highest gun ownership rates in the world, mass shootings are rare, and the shootings shocked the country. 

In response, one of the big things the Serbian government did was implementing a weapon surrender scheme. So far 26,000 unregistered weapons, 1.3 million rounds of ammunition and 6,000 explosives have been voluntarily surrendered. 

It’s too soon to know what impact this will have on Serbia’s gun ownership rates – but we can look at Australia, where they implemented the world's largest mandatory buyback program in 1996. Nearly three decades later, Australia has removed more than 650,000 guns from the streets. To understand what the data says about the effects of the program regarding gun deaths and mass shootings, check out our explainer above.

In 2013, a divided Supreme Court gutted one of the major pillars of the 1965 Voting Rights Act. In the 10 years since then, the court has moved even farther to the right. So when the Voting Rights Act came before the Supreme Court again in 2022, it didn’t look good for the law. But then something completely unexpected happened: in a 5-4 decision, two of the conservative justices voted with the 3 liberal justices to preserve the Voting Rights Act. And the effects could be huge.

At stake in the case was the way that Alabama divides up its Congressional districts. Alabama has seven districts, one of which is what’s called a “majority-minority district” in which Black Americans are the majority of the population. In 2022, a group of Black voters sued the state, saying that under the law, Alabama should actually have two majority-minority districts. And the Supreme Court agreed.

The reason this matters to the rest of the country is that Alabama’s not alone — several other states in the south are now vulnerable to similar challenges that would increase the number of majority-minority districts. And especially in a region of the country where voting is racially polarized — where white people overwhelmingly vote Republican and Black people vote Democrat — this decision has the potential to flip multiple Congressional seats in the next election. And in a US House of Representatives where Republicans only hold control by a margin of 10 votes or so, that’s a big deal.

Sources and further reading:

In 2021 every state in the US with more than one Congressional district redrew them. CNN has a great tool that looks at each state’s Congressional district map before and after that redistricting, and tracks how many majority-minority districts each state has: https://www.cnn.com/interactive/2022/politics/us-redistricting/georgia-redistricting-map/

FiveThirtyEight has a similar tool: https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/redistricting-2022-maps

Many of those new district maps are under legal challenge. The Brennan Center for Justice has a really thorough roundup of every legal case underway against those maps: https://www.brennancenter.org/our-work/research-reports/redistricting-litigation-roundup-0

The Brennan Center also has a great summary of the Alabama case: https://www.brennancenter.org/our-work/research-reports/merrill-v-milligan-gerrymandering-supreme-court

A big part of the Alabama case was determining whether drawing a second majority-black district would be easy. The mathematician Moon Duchin wrote a brief report for the court that demonstrates that really succinctly: https://www.brennancenter.org/sites/default/files/2022-02/Duchin_Report.pdf

The Guardian built a cool interactive that shows the gerrymandering in Alabama really well: https://www.theguardian.com/law/2023/jun/08/alabama-discrimination-black-voters-map-supreme-court

Have you ever wondered why Disney World is located where it is? Or how it came to be such a massive, self-contained universe? It’s a story that involves secret land deals, special districts, and, now, a corporation and a government locked in a feud.

The story of why Disney World is in Florida marries business and governmental concerns about the creation of the massive property. The engineering ranges from unique physical construction (like the creation of a lake) to unique legal construction (like the creation of a self-running government that could even build its own sewer system).

Further Reading:
Buying Disney’s World (https://www.amazon.com/Buying-Disneys-World-Florida-Swampland/dp/1733642056) by Aaron H. Goldberg is an authoritative work about the purchase of Disney. Drawing from corporate records, internal histories, and more, it’s a comprehensive narrative about Disney World’s creation and early years.

There are a lot of great Disney fan websites out there that are obsessive in their Disney coverage. I found Jim Hill’s history of Reedy Creek to be a good intro to the topic. (https://jimhillmedia.com/history-reedy-creek-improvement-district-part-1/)

Disney news is also vibrant on YouTube. Mickey Views provides good perspective on the current battles.

ILaU78Oo7XM,Vox,UCLXo7UDZvByw2ixzpQCufnA,How streaming caused the TV writers strike,2023-06-07 12:00:11+00:00,"The way scripted television gets made today has transformed the careers of writers.

Thousands of television and film writers who are part of the Writers Guild of America are in the middle of a historic strike. They're forming picket lines in front of studios, and productions in New York and Los Angeles and shutting down active sets. The last time they went on strike was 15 years ago — when streaming’s impact on the film and television industry was only just taking shape. This time around, they are striking for better residuals and rights against the looming threat of AI, among other concerns. 

At the core of this dispute is streaming and how it's revolutionized the industry. Companies like Netflix, Hulu, Apple TV+, and more have given consumers an unprecedented array of films and TV shows and opened the door to new voices that don’t have to adhere to mainstream network formats. On the other hand, streaming has also changed how television gets produced, the role writers play, and how they get paid. We interviewed four television writers and showrunners about how streaming has changed how they work, how their incomes have taken a hit, and why it has become harder than ever to build a career.

Movie fight scenes at their best are spectacular, visceral, and impactful. Films like Creed, John Wick, and Bullet Train have scenes that make you feel every punch.

But not all fight scenes are created equal. We’ve all seen scenes that rely on quick cuts to conceal the absence of actual physical contact, or scenes that just don’t land. Crafting a fight that immerses the audience and makes them feel like they’re in the midst of the action requires a delicate dance between choreography, the work of stunt performers, strategic camera angles, immersive sound effects, and, above all, a compelling story.

Most of the time, actors and stuntmen aren’t really hitting each other. So how do they make it feel realistic? In Vox’s latest, stunt coordinator and second unit director Wade Eastwood breaks down the artistry behind creating on-screen battles that leave a lasting impact on viewers, even when the punches aren’t real.

Subscribe and turn on notifications 🔔  so you don't miss any videos: http://goo.gl/0bsAjO 

On December 19, 2018, protests broke out in small cities throughout Sudan amid an economic crisis, eventually reaching the country's capital, Khartoum. These protests posed the biggest challenge to Sudan's longest-serving dictator, Omar al-Bashir, who throughout his regime did everything he could to remain in power. Bashir relied on various security sectors to protect him from being overthrown. However, his plan ultimately failed on April 11, 2019, when the country's army, the Sudanese Armed Forces, and a paramilitary force, the Rapid Support Forces, sided with the protesters and carried out a military coup, toppling Bashir.

The end of Bashir's regime brought hope to the protesters, but they remained skeptical about the men who had overthrown him. SAF’s Abdel Fattah Burhan and RSF’s Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo (aka Hemeti) took control of the country after the coup and made repeated promises to hand over power to civilians, which would put Sudan on a democratic path. But they continuously delayed fulfilling their promises and instead turned against each other, vying for power in Sudan. The two men have brutally interrupted Sudan’s pro-democracy revolution.

The fighting between the two men's forces started out in Sudan's capital, Khartoum, and spread all over the country. Recent ceasefire breakdowns have led to more bursts of violence, especially in Darfur, a region still reeling from the aftermath of a genocide at the hands of Bashir's regime.

Watch the latest episode of Atlas to understand how their feud has undermined the democratic aspirations of the protesters and put Sudan at risk of a civil war.

Every few years, thousands of teenagers are asked a very simple question: What job do you expect to have when you're 30? 

It's an important question because having an answer helps teenagers plan for the future, whether that's taking a specific class or deciding whether to attend college. That's why the OECD's PISA survey has asked this question since 2000.

But in the last 20 years, we've seen a concerning trend: More and more teenagers name the same basic jobs, like doctor or lawyer, almost as if they're picking jobs out of a children's book. And even more worrisome is that more and more teenagers don't even name a job. 

All of this hints that today's teenagers aren't thinking enough about their future plans – and, fair or not, this lack of career preparation will likely have lifelong consequences.

Note: The headline on this piece has been updated.

Around the time that Israelis celebrate Independence Day, Palestinians commemorate “The Nakba,” or “The Catastrophe.” The Nakba was a series of events, centered around 1948, that expelled hundreds of thousands Palestinians from their homeland and killed thousands. The Nakba isn’t the beginning of the story, but it’s a key part of Palestinian history — and the root of Israel’s creation. 

Prior to the Nakba, Palestine had a thriving population — largely made up of Arabs — that had lived and worked the land for centuries. But with the founding of Zionism, years of British meddling, and a British pledge to help create a Jewish state in Palestine — things began to change drastically. By 1947, with increasing tensions between Jewish settlers and Palestinian Arabs — the British left Palestine, and the UN stepped in with a plan to partition the land into two states. What followed was known as Plan Dalet: operations by Israeli paramilitary groups that violently uprooted Palestinians. An estimated 15,000 Palestinians were killed, more than 500 villages were decimated, and roughly 750,000 Palestinians displaced. 

Most who were expelled from their homes couldn’t return to historic Palestine. And today, millions of their descendants live in refugee camps in Gaza, the West Bank and surrounding countries. The history of the Nakba has been deliberately concealed and often ignored in western narratives around the creation of Israel. In this episode of Missing Chapter, we break down how the Nakba happened — and how it defined the future of Palestine.

When you think back on your favorite movies, you might think about their famous directors or actors. But recently, a new name has become synonymous with indie film culture and appeal, and it’s not an individual, but a studio.

You have to admit, their logo is pretty cool.

A24 swept the 2022 Oscars. They’ve made some of the most distinct and interesting movies and TV shows of the past 10 years. But most importantly, they’ve garnered a reputation for quality — and their brand loyalty so strong that hipster film bros everywhere are wearing A24 t-shirts and caps right now.

But unlike Universal or Paramount, studios that have been around for over a century, A24 has done this in just over a decade. How did this independent film distributor transform into a major player in the entertainment industry in such a short time?

eQ5MyY3nLS8,Vox,UCLXo7UDZvByw2ixzpQCufnA,Why Texas judges have so much power right now,2023-05-11 12:00:34+00:00,"Why is Texas so good at changing policy for the whole US?

In April 2021, Texas sued the US government over immigration policy. But they didn’t sue in Texas’s state capital; or in Washington, DC; or in any of the five federal courthouses along Texas’s border with Mexico. They filed the suit in a small Texas city called Victoria, far from any important government officials or immigration centers. And they did it there because they knew that if they did, a judge named Drew Tipton would be assigned to their case.

In the time since Joe Biden has become president, Texas has sued the federal government 31 times. That’s a lot, but what’s more striking is that eight of those lawsuits have been heard by Judge Tipton specifically. The reason that’s weird is that, normally, judges are supposed to be assigned to cases randomly. But in Texas, you can choose your judge. It’s called “judge shopping” and it’s made Texas judges some of the most powerful in the country.

It’s not just the state of Texas filing suits. In 2022 a private group called the Alliance For Hippocratic Medicine filed a suit demanding that the FDA take mifepristone, a widely used abortion medication approved in 2000, off the market. And they filed the suit in Amarillo, Texas, where the judge Matthew Kacsmaryk hears 100 percent of the cases. Kacsmaryk had previously been a lawyer for right-wing causes before he was a judge, and he ruled accordingly, ordering that the FDA ban mifepristone throughout the US.

In the mifepristone case, the Supreme Court stepped in and paused the decision, but the fact that it got so close to being banned shows how empowered Texas federal judges are by the rules of Texas district courts. These judges, most of whom were appointed by Donald Trump, are playing a huge role in shaping national policy, and they’ve turned Texas into a powerful weapon against the federal government.

EKPFZPyQurA,Vox,UCLXo7UDZvByw2ixzpQCufnA,Should we reflect sunlight to cool the planet?,2023-05-04 12:00:16+00:00,"Solar geoengineering might help lower temps, but it’s a controversial approach.

Subscribe and turn on notifications 🔔  so you don't miss any videos: http://goo.gl/0bsAjO 

The climate change crisis has become so dire that we’re being forced not only to think of ways to curb emissions and mitigate greenhouse gases, but of ways to adapt to our current situation to buy ourselves more time.

One of those technologies is called solar geoengineering. It happens in nature when huge volcanic eruptions cover the stratosphere with ash: That ash forms a layer that reflects sunlight and cools the planet underneath. Solar geoengineering takes advantage of that principle, using different scientific methods to make the planet more reflective overall. The problem is, deploying it would require messing with our very complicated climate on a massive scale, and many scientists don’t think the risks are worth it. 

To get an in-depth look at the pros and cons of solar geoengineering, we interviewed a slew of experts on both sides of the issue. Watch our explainer to decide where you stand.

How does an AI artist maintain consistency with a recurring character? While AI art may appear to involve just a few clicks, it can be quite time-consuming.

The video above demonstrates the abridged workflow of the anonymous creator behind ""Stelfie"" — a time-traveling selfie-taker. The artist's process involves custom 3D-generated heads, initial sketches, and extensive toggling between Photoshop and the AI program Stable Diffusion to achieve the ideal appearance.

Throughout this process, the artist employs typical AI art tools such as inpainting (modifying specific image areas), outpainting (extending beyond the frame), and denoising (controlling image alterations). AI art can be as labor-intensive as traditional art, but its distinct outcomes make the final product unique.

In the past few decades, solar and wind energy have made remarkable progress; they're now satisfying significant portions of our energy demand. But there's a problem holding us back from relying on them even more: They can’t be stored very well. 

Solar energy is only generated while the sun is up, and wind energy while the wind is blowing. But our power grids are designed to respond to demand whenever it occurs. Even suddenly, as is the case with storms and heat waves. 

When solar and wind are not available and demand spikes, the power companies need to burn fossil fuels — particularly natural gas, because it can be stored easily. If we ever want a power grid that relies solely on solar and wind energy, we’ll need to come up with ways to store them. Luckily, experts and engineers worldwide are coming up with some genius plans. 

Watch the video above to learn more about how we might be able to store solar and wind energy and, finally, transition away from fossil fuels.

The quest for computer vision requires lots of data — including real world images. But that can be hard to find, which has led researchers to look in some pretty creative places.

The above video shows how researchers used Tik Tok dances and the Mannequin Challenge to train AI. The quest is for “ground truth” — real world examples that can be used to train or grade an AI on its guesses. Tik Tok datasets provide this by showing lots of movement, clothing types, backgrounds, and people. That diversity is key to train a model that can handle the randomness of the real world.

The same thing happens with the Mannequin Challenge — all those people pretending to stand still gave researchers — and their models — more real world data to train with than they ever could have hoped for.

Subscribe and turn on notifications 🔔 so you don't miss any videos: http://goo.gl/0bsAjO 

Cement accounts for 8 percent of our global carbon emissions. It’s also an incredibly difficult material to do without: It’s the glue that holds together the rock, sand, and water in concrete. And concrete is the building block of the world: It’s in our buildings, our streets, our sidewalks, and our infrastructure. Aside from water, there’s no material on earth we use more of.

In order to get to net-zero CO2 emissions by 2050, we’ll have to address how we build and how we make cement. Because cement production is so closely linked to urbanization and development, China accounts for a vast majority of today’s cement-related emissions. Other countries with more development in their future will need to emit more emissions to produce cement, too. All that means the whole world needs to figure out how to create cement without the emissions. This video goes into the steps developed by researchers for how to get there.

The greenscreen is a staple of visual effects — and it may stick around even in the age of AI “magic.” The video above explains why.

It turns out that greenscreens, while imperfect, provide certain background separation benefits that are tough for AI to replicate due to the way it’s been trained and the limitations of available data. Preparation can help improve results, but this video shows why, ultimately, AI tools will remain one in a suite of options rather than a greenscreen killer.

Since 2009, the price of solar energy has come down by 90 percent. That’s no accident. It’s the result of policy interventions from the US to Germany to China. 

As policy analyst Gregory Nemet puts it, “No one country is responsible. It was a relay race rather than a competition.” The global flow of knowledge, people, technology, and policy helped bring down the price per watt from more than $100 in 1976 to less than $0.50 today, according to this analysis from the folks at Our World in Data. https://ourworldindata.org/cheap-renewables-growth 

If we can learn the right lessons from solar’s success, it could help us develop and deploy the technology we need to keep our planet habitable and avoid the worst impacts of climate change.

Large language models are astonishingly good at understanding and producing language. But there’s an often overlooked bias toward languages that are already well-represented on the internet. That means some languages might lose out in AI’s big technical advances.

Some researchers are looking into how that works — and how to possibly shift the balance from these “high resource” languages to ones that haven’t yet had a huge online footprint. These approaches range from original dataset creation, to studying the outputs of large language models, to training open source alternatives.

Watch the video above to learn more.

Subscribe and turn on notifications 🔔  so you don't miss any videos: http://goo.gl/0bsAjO 

Donald Trump is now the first former US President to face criminal charges. He pleaded not guilty to 34 counts of falsifying business records in the first degree.

This case involves hush money that Trump’s lawyer paid to an alleged former sexual partner. But it’s actually just one of four criminal investigations into the former president. The other three investigations focus on his behavior after the 2020 presidential election. 

A Georgia team is examining Trump’s efforts to persuade Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger to “find” more Trump votes after the votes had been counted and Raffensperger had declared Joe Biden the winner. 

Federal special prosecutor Jack Smith is heading up the other two investigations. One group is looking at the Trump team’s attempts to persuade officials in a handful of states where Biden won not to certify his victory, and instead to claim Trump won the state despite the vote counts. 
The other federal investigation is focused on classified documents that Trump brought with him from the White House to his Florida estate after losing the 2020 election. According to reports from the Washington Post and the New York Times, when the FBI searched his estate in August 2022, they found documents related to nuclear weapons, as well as files containing information that could put US informants in the field in danger. 

As president, Trump didn’t just say outrageous things, he acted in unprecedented ways. Now that he’s out of office, investigators in a variety of jurisdictions are trying to figure out if he broke the law, too.

Subscribe and turn on notifications 🔔  so you don't miss any videos: http://goo.gl/0bsAjO 

In recent years, over 70 countries have committed to net-zero carbon emissions, aiming to become carbon neutral by mid-century. The 2015 Paris Agreement aimed to keep global warming below 2 degrees Celsius and ideally limit it to 1.5 degrees above pre-industrial levels. Despite global efforts, emissions are still rising, and achieving the 1.5-degree goal has become increasingly difficult.

Most pathways to keep warming below 2 degrees, and eventually return back to 1.5 rely on negative emissions, which involve pulling carbon dioxide from the atmosphere using carbon dioxide removal (CDR) methods like enhanced weathering and direct air capture.

However, these techniques are still in early development stages, and require land, energy, and money. Critics argue that relying on CDR implicitly encourages governments and companies to postpone necessary emissions reductions because counting on CDR now means relying on future generations of leaders to deliver on those promises. Preventing emissions is broadly less costly than cleaning them up after the fact. But even with dramatic cuts to emissions, experts say some amount of CDR will still be necessary.

Hands drawn by robots … often just don’t look right. Why is that, and what will it take to get better?

Producer Phil Edwards is exploring five different aspects of AI that help explain everything from large language models to where unusual training data comes from. In this first video, he digs into why AI art struggles with hands. The challenges range from the same ones that human artists face to those that are a unique result of how AI generative art is created. The road to improving these hands may not be as obvious as you’d think.

Most of us use our voices every day to communicate one way or another, but the way we produce sound is so much more than the words we say. Our voices are about as unique as fingerprints — similar instruments, but with endless variations.

As humans, we each essentially produce sound in the same physiological way, but it’s not as simple as plucking a guitar string. And when we talk we’re dropping clues about who we are, what we do, and where we’re from. A dialect can hint where a person is from. An expressive range might suggest a person is a singer or actor. A slow and quiet tone could mean a person is feeling sad or tired. Check out the video above to learn more about the ins and outs of how we produce sounds and why no one else sounds like you.

gmehUgOy5ok,Vox,UCLXo7UDZvByw2ixzpQCufnA,Why China's population is shrinking,2023-03-27 12:00:35+00:00,"And why that’s a big deal.

Subscribe and turn on notifications 🔔  so you don't miss any videos: http://goo.gl/0bsAjO 

For the first time in six decades, China’s population is shrinking, and it’s predicted it could create a demographic crisis. That’s because China isn’t just shrinking, it’s also aging. And the majority of Chinese couples are not considering having more than one child. Because of this, China is predicted to lose nearly 50 percent of its population by 2100. 

China’s population decline can be traced back to the restrictive family-planning policies launched in the 1970s and an impressive economic boom fueled by China’s huge labor force. 
China’s modernization brought rapid urbanization, rising income levels, and better education to large parts of China. Combined, these policies and growth have given China one of the lowest birth rates in the world. 

Today, China is trying to reverse its population decline. Not just because an aging population is hard to sustain economically, but because China’s impressive economic growth, until now, has relied on its people. As China’s population challenges deepen over time, it might have to rethink how to grow its economy and care for its citizens. 

You can explore China’s birth and death rate data via the United Nations Population portal, here:
https://population.un.org/wpp/Graphs/Probabilistic/MORT/Deaths/156
https://population.un.org/wpp/Graphs/Probabilistic/FERT/Births/156

As well as the country’s total population and predictions here:
https://population.un.org/wpp/Graphs/Probabilistic/POP/TOT/156

Here are some key facts about China’s declining population from Pew Research:
https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2022/12/05/key-facts-about-chinas-declining-population/

You can read some surprising details about China’s family planning policies — for example,  the One-Child Policy was actually less impactful than the Later, Longer, Fewer campaign — here: https://scholar.harvard.edu/files/martinwhyte/files/challenging_myths_published_version.pdf

Here’s an overview of China’s economic development from the World Bank:
https://www.worldbank.org/en/country/china/overview

And a report on China’s income gap:
https://www.aeaweb.org/research/charts/china-income-gap-rural-urban

For an in-depth look at the cruelty and human cost of China’s One-Child policy, I recommend the documentary One Child Nation by Nanfu Wang:

You can explore population pyramids from across the world on the US Census Bureau’s website:

Finally, our expert, Professor Wang Feng, believes China’s population growth can be framed in a positive light. To understand how, read this piece he wrote for the New York Times:

When Russia first invaded Ukraine in 2014, the US was hesitant to send more than supplies to the Ukrainian army. But when Russia launched a full-scale invasion in 2022, the US changed its tune. President Joe Biden quickly began approving huge packages of weapons to help Ukraine stymie the Russian attack. And for the first couple of weeks, it worked. The Ukrainian army used weapons from the US and its Western allies to stop Russia from capturing Kiev. 

As the war progressed, so did US help. It sent heavy artillery in the spring, and then agreed to eventually send tanks in winter 2023. But each time, it deliberated over whether Ukraine can effectively use the weapons, and whether they'll provoke Russia to escalate the conflict.

So far, that hasn’t happened, and the US and its allies are now considering sending Ukraine very advanced long-range missiles and F-16 fighter jets. Both would be game-changers for Ukraine.

Subscribe and turn on notifications 🔔 so you don't miss any videos: http://goo.gl/0bsAjO 

The brain isn’t naturally wired to read. It’s a task that requires explicit instruction for our brains to activate different areas, including those that control vision, sound, and meaning. For fluent readers, the result is a complicated reading circuit — connected by neural pathways of white matter — to allow us to process words within milliseconds. But this reading circuit looks different for people with dyslexia. 

For decades, the research was largely focused on how this different brain organization often resulted in delays and difficulty in areas like reading, spelling, and grammar. And today, there continues to be stigma and misconceptions around a dyslexia diagnosis. 

But the challenges of dyslexia often overshadow another part of the picture. Research has repeatedly shown dyslexia is also associated with specific cognitive strengths. These include visuo-spatial processing, narrative memory, problem-solving, and reasoning. While there is still a lot to learn about these advantages and how they work, in the piece above we unpack what we know about dyslexia, and what many studies have concluded about these strengths. 

This perspective could be critical — not just for the roughly 20 percent of people who have dyslexia — but for the colleagues, peers, and educators who can better empower dyslexic thinking and better understand neurodiversity.

laPaezEsteI,Vox,UCLXo7UDZvByw2ixzpQCufnA,Ozempic is a game-changer. Here’s how it works.,2023-03-14 12:00:36+00:00,"This diabetes drug could be the future of weight management.

Subscribe and turn on notifications 🔔 so you don't miss any videos: http://goo.gl/0bsAjO 

Ozempic, a medication developed to manage type 2 diabetes, has been in the news a lot lately because of one of its signature side effects: drastic weight loss. Both Ozempic and Wegovy, Ozempic’s counterpart approved specifically for weight loss by the FDA, are brand names of a drug called semaglutide. Semaglutide is one of several drugs that mimics a crucial digestive hormone called glucagon-like peptide 1, or GLP-1. It amplifies a process our bodies perform naturally.

GLP-1 is released in our intestines when we eat, and there are receptors for the hormone in cells all over the body. In the pancreas, GLP-1 promotes the production of insulin and suppresses the production of glucagon. This helps insulin-resistant bodies, like those with type 2 diabetes or obesity, manage blood sugar levels. In the stomach, GLP-1 slows gastric emptying, extending the feeling of being full. In the brain, GLP-1 suppresses appetite, which also promotes satiety and curbs hunger, so we eat less. 

In late 2022, a rush to use Ozempic off-label for weight loss, likely prompted by its sudden rise in popularity in social media, led to a shortage of the drug for people who need it. But more drugs like semaglutide are currently in the process of being approved by the FDA to be prescribed for weight loss, likely signaling an end to the shortage and a promising new generation of medical treatment of obesity.

One of the most exciting things about Top Gun: Maverick is their emphasis on practical effects. Most times, when you see the film’s actors struggling against high-level g-forces, that struggle is real. The actors spent months training to be in planes doing their own stunts, and the whole film feels grounded because of it.

Most times these sequences were shot practically … but not every time. In the film's incredible seven-minute opener (also known as the Darkstar sequence), nearly everything we see is completely fake. The plane used to go Mach 10 doesn’t really exist yet. It’s a prototype for a plane that will exist in the future, built by Lockheed Martin. While a prototype of that plane was used for taxiing around the runway, anytime we see the plane in the air it’s entirely VFX — impeccable VFX. But beyond the VFX, the thing that makes it feel so real is the sound design. 

In this video, Top Gun: Mavericks supervising sound producer Al Nelson breaks down the Darkstar sequence. He explains how his team made a plane that doesn’t exist sound real, and, more importantly, how they leveraged the sound design to be just as emotionally impactful as a piece of orchestrated music.

Over the past few decades, children around the world have been diagnosed with nearsightedness at increasingly high rates. Nearsightedness, or myopia, can stabilize over time, but it doesn’t get better — meaning that myopes will rely on glasses, contact lenses, or corrective surgery to see for their entire lives. 

The blurriness associated with myopia is caused by eyeballs that have grown too long; in a stretched-out shape, eyes aren’t able to properly focus images onto the retina. Researchers believe that two culprits are to blame: the lack of outdoor play, and prolonged time doing up-close activities like using digital devices. 

In some countries — like Singapore, Taiwan, and South Korea, where over 80 percent of students graduating high school are myopic — intervening the progression of myopia has become a nationwide effort.

uyVCneA_e3o,Vox,UCLXo7UDZvByw2ixzpQCufnA,How America’s richest donate their money,2023-03-03 13:00:46+00:00,"Billionaires don’t give the same way we do.

Subscribe and turn on notifications 🔔 so you don't miss any videos: http://goo.gl/0bsAjO 

Every year, publications like Forbes release lists detailing the generosity of society’s richest philanthropists. But the raw numbers of their donations don’t tell the whole story of how ultra-wealthy charitable giving tends to work. We took that data and put it on a big chart that highlights exactly how much of each billionaire’s personal wealth is going toward charitable giving.

This video outlines how wealth inequality creates a distorted view of the generosity of America’s billionaires. We examine the causes their money goes to support, like education and public health. And we break down the actual methods they use to move massive amounts of donated money around, like foundations and secretive donor-advised funds.  

Measuring wealth and philanthropic giving is difficult and subjective. We relied on Forbes’s specific methodology for our chart, but lists like the Chronicle of Philanthropy’s “The Philanthropy 50” use their own methods. https://www.philanthropy.com/article/the-philanthropy-50/#id=browse_2022

Correction: In a previous version of this video, the equation at 1:05 was incorrectly flipped. We've updated the animation. 

Here is the original Forbes list we mention in the video: 
https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbeswealthteam/2023/01/23/americas-top-givers-2023-the-25-most-philanthropic-billionaires/?sh=320dd0692e9e

If you’re wondering why Elon Musk isn’t on the Forbes list despite a $5.7 billion donation of Tesla shares in 2021, it’s probably because it was speculated that the money went to a donor-advised fund: 
https://www.forbes.com/sites/elizahaverstock/2022/02/15/elon-musk-reports-donating-57-billion-to-charity-but-there-is-no-trace-of-that-gift-yet/?sh=4d2dd8fd2782

They also do their own guide on “giving scores”: 
https://www.forbes.com/sites/rachelsandler/2022/09/27/the-forbes-philanthropy-score-2022-how-charitable-are-the-richest-americans/?sh=6bfe3b14a098

The inspiration for this chart came from this Reddit post using numbers from a previous Forbes list: 
https://www.reddit.com/r/dataisbeautiful/comments/ym3ddi/oc_forbes_2022s_most_philanthropic_us_billionaires/

It all has to do with how our bodies use fat — specifically brown fat, a lesser-known type of fat that can produce roughly 300 times more heat than any other tissue in the body. 

Brown fat isn’t the type of fat that adds to our weight (that’s white fat). Brown fat has the sole purpose of being burnt for heating the body, and it’s extremely effective at that. It only appears in specific parts of the body: around the neck, spine, heart, and kidneys. (It clumps around major blood vessels, in order to warm the blood as it passes through the body.)

But brown fat is temporary and can adapt to pressure in a similar way to muscles. Check out the latest Vox video to learn more!

Right now, inflation is inescapable. At the grocery store, the gas station, and in almost every country in the world, people are playing more — way more — than they did just a couple of years ago for everything.

In this video, we explore three explanations for why prices are rising, as well as different policy options for bringing them down.

ZoLk6GUKzU0,Vox,UCLXo7UDZvByw2ixzpQCufnA,How South Koreans got so much taller,2023-02-23 15:29:09+00:00,"Humans have gotten a lot taller in the past 100 years — and South Korea shows us why

A century ago, humans were quite short. For example, the average South Korean woman was about 4-foot-7, or 142 centimeters, while the average American woman was about 5-foot-2, or 159 centimeters. Humans were fairly short by today’s standards, and that was true throughout nearly all of human history.

But in the past century, human heights have skyrocketed. Globally, humans grew about 3 inches on average, but in South Korea, women grew an astounding 8 inches and men grew 6 inches.

South Korea is a unique example. In the early part of the 20th century, South Korea was a poor and hungry country. But drastic economic growth fueled improved living conditions. 

For example, in 1961 the country’s food supply was about ​​2,100 calories per person; by 2013, each person had about 1,200 additional calories available, according to data from the UN’s Food and Agriculture Organization. UN data also shows that in 1950, about 20 percent of South Korean infants died before age 1, but now it’s about 0.2 percent.

However, South Korea’s improved living conditions are a harsh contrast to North Korea. For half of the 20th century, the south and north were one country. Heights in those two regions were nearly identical. So what happened to human height in North Korea after an authoritarian regime took over and closed off its borders?

On the morning of February 6, a pair of powerful earthquakes, 7.8 and 7.6,  hit Turkey and Syria. On top of that, the region was hit with strong aftershocks, which made the destruction even worse. The death toll is already in the tens of thousands with many victims still lying beneath the rubble. 

Multiple factors led to this earthquake being so devastating, like fault lines, neighborhoods still reeling from war and delayed rescue missions. But what made this earthquake particularly catastrophic was unsafe buildings. According to the Turkish government, over 6,000 buildings collapsed because of this earthquake. And that’s likely because of the way they were built.

This video will explain how bad building design made the Turkey-Syria earthquake more deadly than it had to be. 

Correction: The map at 5:49 has been updated with correct labels. A previous version of this video had incorrectly swapped Peru and Ecuador. Additionally, the animation at 2:32 was updated to reflect the columns can often be made out of brittle concrete.

On January 10, 2023, the Ukrainian town of Soledar was reportedly captured. But it wasn’t captured by the Russian army under Vladimir Putin’s command. The announcement came from a relatively unknown man, Yevgeny Prigozhin, who said his troops now controlled the town. The troops are part of the Wagner Group, a private army that has become a prominent force alongside Russian troops in the war against Ukraine. 

But they aren’t new. They've been secretly fighting for Russia around the world since 2014. In this video, we take a look at their playbook and examine the three main steps they use to spread Russian influence around the world in brutal ways. We also look at how they’ve transformed from a ghost army to a recognizable private military group with insignias and an online brand, changing the nature of this secret group and its role in the world.

Maybe you’ve noticed: In the past 10 years everything we buy from clothes to technology has gotten just a little bit worse. Sweaters are more likely to tear. Phones are more likely to break. Smart toasters and TVs burn out and die after only a few years. It might seem like consumer products just aren’t built to last anymore. What’s going on?

Unfortunately (and fortunately!), part of the problem is us. For decades, we’ve been conditioned to buy, buy, buy, and today it’s normal for many consumers to shop for new clothes at least once a month. In order to keep up, many companies have to prioritize making things in the fastest and least expensive way possible. To do that, they cut corners with materials and labor. In turn, quality suffers, which leaves consumers with a lot of crappy things.

The story with technology is a little different. And the biggest difference is that while no one in fashion is saying you’re not allowed to sew a new button on a shirt, many tech companies have actually made it impossible to repair their products. 

The good news is consumers have a surprising amount of control over this situation. Watch the video to learn more.

In October 2022, the Biden administration placed a large-scale ban on the sale of advanced semiconductor chips to China. They also implemented a series of other rules that prevents China from making these chips on their own. These chips are used in everyday technology, like our mobile phones and computers. They’re also crucial to military and intelligence systems, which is one of the main reasons they're at the center of a feud between the United States and China. 

Microchips were first invented in the US in the 1950s, after which their use rapidly expanded worldwide. Since then, the supply chain for these chips has grown and spread to include countries in Europe and Asia. And while some countries have caught up to the US's edge in making these advanced chips, China still falls far behind despite multiple attempts to gain an advantage.

Watch the latest episode of Vox Atlas to understand why China is losing a new cold war with the US over microchips.

K64wRD8eaus,Vox,UCLXo7UDZvByw2ixzpQCufnA,Why the Titanic didn't have enough lifeboats,2023-02-06 13:00:11+00:00,"An outdated safety law may have cost hundreds of lives.

Subscribe and turn on notifications 🔔 so you don't miss any videos: http://goo.gl/0bsAjO 

Ever since the Titanic sank on April 15, 1912, a major suspected culprit for the high death toll has been that there weren’t enough lifeboats on board. It’s a decision that's been dramatized as hubris on the part of the White Star Line — but the ship actually surpassed safety standards for the time. 

The Merchant Shipping Act of 1894 required the largest-class ships, those weighing over 10,000 tons, to carry at least 16 lifeboats. Even though the Titanic, which launched in 1911, weighed 45,000 tons, that minimum was the same. The Titanic carried 20 lifeboats, with a capacity for roughly half of the people on board the night the ship sank. 

Until the Titanic disaster, lifeboats weren’t seen as a substitute for an entire ship. The giant liner itself, which featured 16 compartments separated by watertight bulkheads, was supposed to stay afloat even after taking on water. Then, using a brand new piece of technology — the Marconi wireless telegraph — signal for help from a nearby ship, using lifeboats to methodically ferry passengers off the sinking ship.

This scenario played out perfectly just a couple years before the Titanic disaster, when a ship accidentally rammed RMS Republic in 1909. The Republic sank, but nearly everyone on board was safely ferried off. The prevailing thought at the time was that disasters at sea had become a thing of the past. 

When the Titanic went down, that all changed. Just two years later, the International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea (SOLAS) mandated all passenger ships carry lifeboats for everyone on board. Today, the SOLAS requirement is 125% of a ship’s capacity.

Subscribe and turn on notifications 🔔 so you don't miss any videos: http://goo.gl/0bsAjO 

In late summer of 2022, Pakistan experienced a devastating flooding event. An unusually severe monsoon season induced by climate change resulted in a third of the country being covered with water. Over 1,600 lives were lost, and water took months to drain out of lower-lying regions of the country, causing disease and displacement. 

On the flip side, Pakistan is among the most water-scarce countries in the world — expected to reach absolute water scarcity by 2025 if nothing changes. You can’t remove climate change from this equation, but an overlooked factor is the role that British engineering played in building water infrastructure along the Indus River and its tributaries, Pakistan’s sole source of surface water. 

A series of perennial canals, dam-like structures called barrages, and embankments were built to extract as much water from the Indus as possible and convert much of Pakistan’s arid landscape into farmland. But this water infrastructure exacerbates the destruction of flooding events and creates a hierarchical system along the canals in terms of water access. 

In our video, we explain the design of this water infrastructure and how Pakistan’s colonial past has made the country’s relationship with water even more precarious. 

Daanish Mustafa, who we interviewed for this video, co-authored a report on Pakistan’s water crisis:

Have you ever been watching a show or movie, and then a character delivers a line so unintelligible you have to scramble to find the remote and rewind? For me, this moment came during the climax of the Pete Davidson film “The King of Staten Island,” where his most important line was impossible to understand. 

I had to rewind three times — and eventually put subtitles on — to finally pick up what he was saying.

This experience isn’t unique — gather enough people together and you can generally separate them into two categories: People who use subtitles, and people who don’t. And according to a not-so-scientific YouTube poll we ran on our Community tab, the latter category is an endangered species — 57% of you said you always use subtitles, while just 12% of you said you generally don’t.
 
But why do so many of us feel that we need subtitles to understand the dialogue in the things we watch?

The answer to that question is complex – and we get straight to the bottom of it in this explainer, with the help of dialogue editor Austin Olivia Kendrick.

Subscribe to our channel! http://goo.gl/0bsAjO

In 2022, the world population crossed 8 billion people — and we felt the scale of this monumental milestone in hundreds of ways. After over two years of lockdowns and quarantines, people eagerly restarted their lives, but there were certainly growing pains. Weddings and travel skyrocketed, but so did lost luggage and global inflation rates. Taylor Swift broke Ticketmaster. Cryptocurrency was headed toward a great year until it really, really wasn’t. 2022 tested the world population as we tested out life in a new phase of the pandemic.

Russia invaded Ukraine, and aid relief flooded into the war-torn country. Refugees were welcomed into surrounding countries, and those who stayed behind inspired people around the world. Global protests cried out for justice in Iran. Football teams stood up for migrant workers and the LGBTQ+ community at the World Cup. Cuba legalized same-sex marriage. The world froze for a moment when England’s longest-reigning monarch, Queen Elizabeth II, died. And we all watched a lot of TikTok. 

As we head into 2023, take a moment to look back at the events that defined this year.

Subscribe and turn on notifications 🔔 so you don't miss any videos: http://goo.gl/0bsAjO 

The Christmas tree tradition as we know it today has a long and varied history. 

It is believed to have roots in ancient cultures, where trees were decorated as part of celebrations. 

In the 1500s and 1600s, the Christmas tree became a Germanic custom, with fir trees being a popular choice. 

In the 1840s, the practice of having a Christmas tree in the home became more widespread, thanks in part to the influence of Queen Victoria and Prince Albert, who were both of German descent. The Christmas tree also gained popularity in the United States during this time due to a large influx of German immigrants. The tradition was further popularized through the mass media, such as The Illustrated London News, and the publication of Christmas cards and books like Charles Dickens' A Christmas Carol. Today, Christmas trees can be found in homes around the world and can even be spotted from satellite images of Christmas tree farms.

Check out the book where the Christmas tree illustration appeared in America: https://archive.org/details/godeysladysbook22phil/page/262/mode/2up?q=%22christmas+tree%22

Here’s a short narrative about President Roosevelt’s “banning” of Christmas trees: https://foresthistory.org/president-bans-christmas-tree/

The death of Mahsa Amini at the hands of Iran's ""morality police"" on September 16, 2022 sparked major protests in Iran. The morality police arrested Amini for improperly wearing her hijab, and after they allegedly beat her, she fell into a coma and died. Protests began by asking for accountability. They’re now demanding regime change. 

In theory, Iranians have a democratic branch they can use to fight for change under the regime. But it's actually all part of the same power structure controlled by Iran’s autocratic supreme leader. Iranians are forced to voice their objections in the streets because the system that protects the morality police, the supreme leader, and the entire power structure of Iran was designed to fight dissent.

During the 1979 revolution, the Iranian military declared neutrality. This led to the shah’s downfall, but it also caused the Supreme Leader to decide he needed a whole new loyal army to protect himself and his ideology. It’s this other arm of Iran’s power system that is also out on the streets, cracking down on protesters, hoping to keep the existing structure in place — the same system many Iranians have been fighting against for 40 years.

Subscribe and turn on notifications 🔔 so you don't miss any videos: http://goo.gl/0bsAjO 

Depending on where you live, there is one plant that you can spot anywhere during the winter holiday season (outside of, well, Christmas trees): poinsettias. It was named for the first US minister to Mexico: Joel Poinsett. In Mexico, Poinsett saw the plant — called cuetlaxochitl by the Aztec and with a long history of use in the region — and shipped some cuttings back to the US.

Many around the world started calling the plant “poinsettia” to celebrate Poinsett’s legacy. But that legacy is a troubling one. Poinsett was a slave owner, a firm believer in American expansion, and during his tenure as secretary of war he oversaw the displacement of thousands of Native Americans. In his role as minister to Mexico, he meddled so much in local politics that he was asked to leave the country. 

Because of that history — and the fact that the US still corners the lucrative poinsettia market while restricting their imports from Mexico — many people today  reject the name poinsettia in favor of the plant’s Native name, cuetlaxochitl. Check out the video above for more on how the US got the poinsettia.

When the British colonized New Zealand, they left the country’s indigenous Māori population with nearly no land; war and new diseases they introduced to the islands nearly killed off all Māori. Nevertheless, Māori managed to survive — and for decades they protested against the British crown’s pillaging. By the 1970s,  the crown could no longer ignore Māori’s mass uprisings rallying for justice; it was forced to respond and established a tribunal to investigate how it violated Māori sovereignty over New Zealand. 

Since 1995, the British crown has been engaged in a process of land settlements with Māori — giving the tribes back land and cash, and offering apologies for their historical and modern-day thefts. By putting billions of dollars into this reparations program since the mid-1990s, New Zealand is leading the world with this kind of atonement and redress. 

In this special episode of Missing Chapter, Vox reporter Fabiola Cineas traveled across New Zealand to explore how Māori are using the compensation to build a new future for themselves — and to investigate what the US can learn about reparations from their story.

There are few places in the world where you can walk into a licensed shop and buy marijuana for recreational use. Uruguay is one (sold in pharmacies). Canada is another. They’re joined by 21 US states, representing 48 percent of the American population, up from zero states in 2013. 

That means that in Idaho, people caught growing or selling weed face mandatory jail time and tens of thousands of dollars in fines while their counterparts next door in Washington can enroll in a state-funded mentor-ship program for cannabis business planning and development. And states like Washington are violating both US federal law which prohibits any use of marijuana, and also international law, which prohibits non-medical uses. 

That’s messy. But it reflects that although large majorities agree that the criminalization of cannabis use was a mistake, there’s less consensus about how exactly to move forward. 

Will Jones III, the Director of Community Engagement & Outreach at Smart Approaches to Marijuana (SAM), maintains that the commercialization of weed would lead to more harm than good. He prefers decriminalization instead, which removes criminal penalties, treating marijuana possession more like a traffic ticket. (Six US states have decriminalized recreational cannabis without legalizing.) However, SAM prioritizes fighting legalization and reducing drug use over promoting decriminalization.

SAM co-drafted the Medical Marijuana and Cannabidiol Research Expansion Act which makes it easier to study marijuana and develop marijuana-derived drugs but without descheduling marijuana as a schedule I illicit substance. President Biden signed it into law in December of 2022. 

Paul Armentano, the Deputy Director of NORML, has spent decades advocating for legalization of marijuana and says decriminalization doesn’t go far enough. NORML represents the interests of cannabis consumers and has been advocating for the removal of criminal penalties for recreational marijuana since 1970. 

We thought both of their perspectives were worth hearing but didn’t want to stage a traditional debate where viewers so often come away confused about what to believe. So we created a format that would help establish a shared foundation of facts while still communicating what each of these advocates believe is the most important information to know.

In this new take on a debate, we asked both participants to identify facts that their opponent would have to concede are true. They were given an opportunity to review their adversary’s facts in advance and in a video call agreed on a set of six. In the video, you’ll see those facts presented, with each participant given the opportunity to add a “footnote” to their opponent’s facts.

Pickleball, a recreational racquet sport that combines tennis, ping pong, and badminton, became a national obsession in the early days of the Covid-19 pandemic. The sport’s popularity is due to the social nature of the game, how easy it is to learn to play, and the game’s portability. With nets that can be set up on any hard surface, the game is generally more accessible than other racquet sports. 

But pickleball’s spike in popularity created a public space problem when crowds of pickleball players began erecting temporary courts on public tennis courts, basketball courts, and parking lots. This, combined with the loud noises produced by rigid paddles and hollow, plastic balls, has created a new fight for space between pickleball players and pretty much everyone else. 

As more pickleball facilities open across the country, the strain on other public spaces has been easing. Now, plans are being developed in cities and towns across the US and Canada to embrace the pickleball boom and develop free, dedicated spaces for the sport.

Ever since Qatar won the rights to host the FIFA World Cup in 2010, its treatment of migrant workers has made international headlines. News stories and human rights organizations revealed migrant workers who built the stadiums, hotels, and all the new infrastructure required for the World Cup were being forced to work, not getting paid, unable to leave, and in some cases, dying.

At the heart of the abuse faced by migrant workers is the kafala system. A system prevalent in Gulf states that ties workers to their sponsors, it often gives sponsors almost total control of migrant workers’ employment and immigration status. 

Due to all the scrutiny Qatar has been under, some reforms have been put in place, but the kafala system is more than a law — it’s a practice. And while these reforms exist on paper, human rights organizations say there’s still a long way to go.

To understand how hundreds of thousands of migrant workers were stuck in an exploitative system while building the stadiums for the World Cup, watch our 10-minute video above.

Subscribe and turn on notifications 🔔 so you don't miss any videos: http://goo.gl/0bsAjO 

The offside rule, which requires attacking players to be behind either the ball or the last defender, is a rule that sounds objective, but has led to a lot of questionable calls, partly because it can only be judged from an individual perspective. Until now. Meet the new “semi-automated AI offsides technology” at the 2022 World Cup.

This technology relies on a sensor in the ball that relays its position on the field 500 times a second, and 12 motion tracking cameras mounted underneath the roof of the stadium that use machine learning to track 29 points in players’ bodies. In other words, FIFA is mo-capping players, just without the funny gray suits. And the whole system will alert referees when a player is offside. If you’ve been watching the World Cup, you may have also seen the motion tracking information being used to create an immediate 3D replay.

This system seems like it could be capable of eliminating “bad” offside calls, or maybe bad calls altogether - but its new precision will inevitably impact gameplay no matter what. And the first World Cup to feature it will show us exactly how.

A World Cup penalty kick shootout can be one of the tensest ways to end a match. But where’s the best spot to place a kick?

Data scientist Pablo López Landeros pored over hundreds of kicks and tracked where keepers dove, where players kicked the ball and, most importantly, when they scored a goal. As the above video shows, the results provided some conclusions — and also raised some questions about the best spot for a penalty kick.

Subscribe to our channel! http://goo.gl/0bsAjO

On December 2, 2010, FIFA announced the 2022 World Cup would take place in a surprising country, Qatar. At that same meeting, they also announced that the 2018 World Cup would take place in Russia. These selections set off a new chapter in FIFA’s history, one where the public would have a greater sense on how bribery and corruption have a huge role in who gets to host this international sporting event. 

The last 14 World Cup locations were decided by a group of 24 powerful men within FIFA called the executive committee. Their votes meant a lot to bidding nations and allegations on bidders bribing members of the committee lingered for decades. These allegations reached a new level when criminal investigations were launched nearly five years after that FIFA announcement. The fallout of these investigations nearly broke FIFA and tainted the World Cup. 

Watch the latest episode of Vox Atlas to understand how FIFA corrupted the World Cup host selection process.

Send us your questions! https://forms.gle/ATu6kYgKNaEXSr3UA

The belief that Donald Trump actually won the 2020 US election is widespread among his most devoted followers. That belief rests on claims of massive voter fraud in the 2020 election that have never been substantiated. And in the 2022 elections, many “election deniers” ran for state-level offices that have direct control over elections, promising to limit access to voting if they won. Of all Republican nominees for election-administration positions this year, over half openly claimed that Trump won in 2020.

But when the election came, the most high-profile of those “election denier” nominees, many of whom were favored to win, actually lost. And the story of why many of them lost is actually the story of thousands of ordinary citizens using the tools of democracy to protect democracy.

Subscribe and turn on notifications 🔔  so you don't miss any videos: http://goo.gl/0bsAjO 

Most American roads aren’t just unpleasant for pedestrians, they can be dangerous. Pedestrian fatalities have been rising in the past few years, and urban planners point to the way roads are designed as the culprit. 

A group of urban planners identified 60 pedestrian fatality hot spots throughout the US, and a 1,000-meter corridor of US-19 in New Port Richey, Florida, topped their list. Seventeen pedestrians lost their lives along this short stretch of road in the study period of 2001 to 2016. 

The fatality hot spots on the study’s list shared a lot of design characteristics. Many of them are  arterial thoroughfares: roads historically built to keep high-speed traffic off of nearby residential streets. But the way US communities developed in a sprawling fashion along these roads meant these roadways also became business centers that pedestrians might need to access. The number of lanes and distances between crosswalks are among other dangerous design elements. 

For this video, we went to New Port Richey to walk along US-19 and document the design characteristics identified in the study. 

--
Correction - A previous version of this video featured an interview that spoke to a memorial at Main Street and US-19. Locals from the New Port Richey area brought to our attention that the interview misrepresented the memorial, which honors a young man who was killed during an accident between two cars, not a bicycle as stated in the interview. Our sincere apologies for including the misrepresentation of the victim's story. We have edited the video to correct that error. 

This is a link to a GoFundMe for the victim's family which includes more details about the incident: https://www.gofundme.com/f/qe5jkz-funeral-expenses-for-logan-blakley

This video is an adaptation of Vox.com reporter Marin Cogan’s investigation of US-19:

Qehsk_-Bjq4,Vox,UCLXo7UDZvByw2ixzpQCufnA,It’s not you - movies are getting darker.,2022-11-09 13:00:16+00:00,"Blame technology for how often you can’t see anything in your favorite shows.

Subscribe and turn on notifications 🔔  so you don't miss any videos: http://goo.gl/0bsAjO 

There’s a trend in movies and TV that you’ve probably noticed: everything has gotten extremely dark, and for some audience members, too dark to even see. 

It comes down to both aesthetics and technology. The first one’s pretty simple: as popular content leans grittier and darker in tone (i.e. The Batman, Stranger Things, Game of Thrones etc) the visuals tend to reflect that.

But productions have also moved from shooting on film to shooting with digital cameras - and the way scenes get lit has changed dramatically. Shooting on film meant that you couldn’t see the final product until everything was developed. Under those limitations, it made more sense to flood dark scenes with light to ensure the footage would be usable. With digital cameras and digital monitors, it’s easy to see what the final product will look like — and that can embolden a cinematographer to film scenes darker and darker.

But how dark is too dark? And how do filmmakers ensure that their vision gets accurately represented on the screen you’re watching it on? Check out this Vox video to find out.

On January 6th, 2021 (yes, during the capitol riots) the final Senate race of the 2020 election was called for a Democrat. All of a sudden Democrats had achieved something improbable: trifecta control of the presidency, Senate, and House of Representatives. It transformed the possibilities for Biden’s first two years, giving his party the ability to legislate on their own - which they did.

The trillion-dollar stimulus, the infrastructure bill, the climate investments of the Inflation Reduction Act — all of that was only possible because of unified Democratic control. But even under divided government, both houses of Congress will still wield an enormous amount of power over national affairs and policy. That’s why the 2022 election results aren't just a referendum on whether Democrats should keep Congress — they'll decide who gets power, how much they'll get, and how they’ll use it. And there are three ways it could all play out.

Lithium-ion batteries are a transformative technology in the fight against climate change. Most notably, they power electric vehicles, which have the potential to replace emissions produced by road transportation. 

But there’s a problem. These batteries require nickel. And in Indonesia, where the majority of nickel is produced, the production process emits large amounts of carbon and pollution. It’s impacting the people who live by the production centers, who are registering an increase in respiratory illnesses. The US is essentially outsourcing carbon emissions and pollution in exchange for green energy. 

It doesn’t have to be this way. Indonesia sits along the Ring of Fire, one of the most geologically active regions in the world, making it an ideal place to produce geothermal energy.

Geothermal energy taps into the heat beneath the ground mostly found in volcanic regions. To use the heat beneath the earth’s surface, we need to drill into the ground, draw up the hot water, and use it to turn turbines that produce electricity. After, the water is funneled back underground, making geothermal a mostly clean and renewable energy source. 

While the exploration and development process of geothermal energy can be expensive, Indonesia already has more than 30 active geothermal facilities. 

As the world’s need for lithium-ion batteries increases, Indonesia and the companies invested in the region have the opportunity to make their processes greener from start to finish — and protect the people that live next to nickel production centers.

To understand the repercussions of nickel production in Indonesia and how geothermal energy could help fix the air pollution and emissions it produces, watch our video.

Is there a way to replace steel and concrete with wood? That’s the idea behind mass timber — a relatively new construction technique that’s making its way from Europe to the United States.

In the above video, you can learn how mass timber changes the construction process. Vox’s Phil Edwards visited Ascent Milwaukee, the tallest mass timber building in the world, to see how it all comes together. Many different partners have to reinvent the construction process to make a building like this a reality.

Subscribe and turn on notifications 🔔  so you don't miss any videos: http://goo.gl/0bsAjO 

On October 2, 2022, Brazilians voted in the first round of their presidential election. The top two finishers were current president Jair Bolsonaro and former president Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva. Both candidates will face each other in a run-off on October 30. Lula is considered likely to win. 

Lula is arguably Brazil’s most well-known and complex politician. He helped form a powerful political party, had two successful terms in office, and even served jail time over corruption and bribery allegations. After four years of Bolsonaro’s presidency, the core of Lula’s campaign has focused on restoring the Brazil of his own presidency. But a lot has changed in Brazil since his time in office.

Watch this video for a glance at Lula’s career and to understand why his second time as president would be very different than his first.

Jake Blount has built a career out of understanding the banjo’s connection to Black American folk music. In this video, he walks us through the instrument’s history — from West Africa to enslaved people in the US to the early record industry — to explain how Black folk music has evolved. 

For example: The early record industry confined Black musicians to “race records” and white musicians to “hillbilly records.” Hillbilly music would have been early country and string band music. Race records restricted Black musicians to blues and jazz genres. Which meant Black musicians playing bluegrass-style banjo weren’t recorded — even if they were responsible for teaching white musicians.  

Using field recordings, their own banjo and fiddle skills, and a deconstructed version of one of their own songs, Jake explains how Black musicians have long been left out of the current canon of folklore recordings and American folk music history. And what he’s doing to keep the tradition alive, with fresh observations and a musical style that looks both forward and backward.  

This video was filmed on location at Hancock Shaker Village in Pittsfield, Massachusetts.

Subscribe and turn on notifications 🔔  so you don't miss any videos: http://goo.gl/0bsAjO 

Many of us have fond memories of visiting the zoo as a child (or at any age), and more than a few of us probably credit those visits with turning us into animal-lovers. So, how should we square those warm fuzzy feelings with research that shows the psychological harms of captivity for some animals? 

That’s what Vox subscriber Gaurav Patil wanted to know, so producer Liz Scheltens started digging in. One way that zoos maintain their social license to operate despite our growing understanding of the harms to certain species is by marketing themselves as beacons of conservation. 

Proponents argue that not only do zoos help preserve endangered wild populations, they also help make humans better conservationists. But when you look at the research, a different picture starts to emerge.

Subscribe and turn on notifications 🔔 so you don't miss any videos: http://goo.gl/0bsAjO 

When a football player throws a tight spiral pass, the ball glides through the air in a smooth arc, its nose pointing up toward the sky at the beginning of the toss, and then dropping down toward the earth as it lands in the receiver's hands.

The spiral pass is so familiar it’s easily overlooked as just being common sense — but it took physicists nearly 20 years to understand this trajectory.

Conservation of angular momentum suggests that the ball should not act this way. It should either keep its nose angled toward the sky the whole time or the ball should be flipping over itself as it moves through the air; but the fact that it just tips over elegantly is — to use a scientific term — weird as hell. 

But it turns out the solution is easy enough to understand — as long as you have a spinning top.

Designing a hiking trail seems simple enough: It has to take a person from A to B, pass through scenic nature, and last through years of wear and tear. And for most of human history, trails did that without much intentional design at all.

But as trails shifted from essential transportation to a recreational destination, the way we make them did, too. Now, hidden in every trail is a carefully made design language of angles, alignment, and materials that keep them enjoyable for generations.

Watch our video to hear trail ecologist Jeffery Marion explain how these principles work — and why they’re more important now than ever.

Over the summer, for the first time in what feels like a while, Americans united under a single cause: to murder an invasive bug.

Okay, that’s a bit dramatic, but the situation itself was a bit dramatic. Social media was flooded with people in New York City, Pennsylvania, and New Jersey striking down spotted lanternflies in the most creative ways. Videos of the plant-sucking bugs that are native to parts of Asia showed them overtaking trees. Reports from Pennsylvania said they were capable of wiping out vineyards. Researchers warned they also threaten fruit trees and the hardwoods like black walnut. The public went on high alert. The messaging was clear: Stop this bug before it decimates the fruit and timber industries and costs the US tons of money.

People struck them down all summer long, and now that it’s fall … well, they’re still here. And they’ve spread.

Is it futile? That depends. If you set out with your flyswatters and sticky traps thinking we could wipe out every lanternfly, then you were a bit misguided. But just because we can’t stop them entirely doesn’t mean we should quit. 

Kristie Reddick, an entomologist and director of The Bug Chicks, put it best: “People cleaning trash out of creeks aren't going to be like, ‘Oh, I picked up, like, three bags of trash and there's still more trash. I guess there's just trash now.’” Spotted lanternflies are the trash in this metaphor. 

Check out the video above to find out more about spotted lanternflies and the part humans have played in spreading them around the US.

SC Johnson’s Administrative Building and Research Tower in Racine, Wisconsin, have become legendary as corporate headquarters buildings. The Administrative Building’s Great Workroom is a stunning example of architect Frank Lloyd Wright’s unique approach to office design.

But what did it really feel like? Vox’s Phil Edwards visited the HQ to find out — and try actually working there. He also visited the Hardy House, an earlier Wright design that features many of the same Wright signatures found in the SC Johnson building, from custom designed furniture to ideas about compression and expansion.

Watch the video to see what it really feels like to work in such a space.

Further Reading:
https://www.amazon.com/Frank-Lloyd-Wright-Johnson-Buildings/dp/048642748X
Jonathan Lipman’s book about Sc Johnson is one of the best-sourced and most comprehensive books about the building’s history.

https://www.amazon.com/Frank-Lloyd-Wrights-Hardy-House/dp/0764937618
Mark Hertzberg’s exhaustive knowledge of the Hardy House — and his experiencing photographing it — is evident in his book about the building. His blog, Wright in Racine (https://wrightinracine.wordpress.com/) also has great facts and stories about Wright’s work.

Subscribe and turn on notifications 🔔  so you don't miss any videos: http://goo.gl/0bsAjO 

The Western United States is currently battling the most severe drought in thousands of years. A mix of bad water management policies and manmade climate change has created a situation where water supplies in Western reservoirs are so low, states are being forced to cut their water use. 

It’s not hard to find media coverage that focuses on the excesses of residential water use: long showers, swimming pools, lawn watering, at-home car washes. Or in the business sector, like irrigating golf courses or pumping water into hotel fountains in Las Vegas. 

But when a team of researchers looked at water use in the West, they uncovered a very different story about where most Western water goes. Their findings may hold the solution to dwindling water supplies in the West. 

Check out the video above to learn more, and take a look at the study that this story is centered on: https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/323061602.pdf

Subscribe and turn on notifications 🔔  so you don't miss any videos: http://goo.gl/0bsAjO 

After centuries of colonizing much of the world, the British Empire began its fast descent in the 1960s amid a global wave of independence movements. But when Queen Elizabeth II died in 2022, she was not only still queen of 14 countries besides the United Kingdom, she was also still the leader of an organization that on a map looks a lot like the British Empire.

The British Empire created the first iteration of the Commonwealth to appease white settler colonies looking for more autonomy. It granted them more independence to govern themselves but kept them under the crown. As British leaders realized their power might be at risk throughout their colonies worldwide, the monarchy made a play to keep ties and preserve their global influence by allowing newly independent republics to join the Commonwealth too. The only catch: They had to accept the queen as the leader of the organization. With the death of Queen Elizabeth II, this vestige of the British Empire is now under the leadership of King Charles III. So, what exactly is the Commonwealth? Why is it still here? And will it survive?

Correction: A previous version of this video mistakenly showed Myanmar as a member of the Commonwealth on a 1994 map, mislabeled Sierra Leone and Gold Coast for a brief moment on a 1927 map, and omitted Greenland, all of which have now been corrected. 

We have also clarified that India became a republic shortly after independence with a new line of narration at 3:12; corrected Queen Elizabeth II’s title at 00:16 and 00:47; and updated the date Barbados became a republic from November 29, 2021, to November 30, 2021.

In the spring and summer of 2022, the war between Ukraine and Russia settled into a stalemate. The first phase of the war had been a rapid invasion that drew new battle lines across Ukraine; this next phase saw those battle lines harden and change very little over a long period of fighting. But in September, that chapter came to an end. For the first time in several months, Ukraine scored a major victory and won back significant territory from Russia.

Ukraine pulled this victory off by taking advantage of a surprising weakness in the Russian army: the difficulty it’s had maintaining its ranks of skilled soldiers, especially compared to the training and resources that Ukraine’s army has received from its allies. Reports suggest that Russia’s army has suffered catastrophic losses in the war, and that it’s attempted to replace those more highly trained forces with large numbers of mercenaries, prisoners, and men over 40. It’s an army that was stretched thin and vulnerable to the multi-pronged attack Ukraine launched in September.

Russia still controls a large amount of territory in southern Ukraine, including two major cities. But Ukraine’s victory outside of Kharkiv signals a new chapter in the war — one where, remarkably, Ukraine seems to have a shot at driving out the Russians completely. Watch the video to learn more about why this attack worked and why it matters so much.

Some sources we drew on for the video:

Subscribe and turn on notifications 🔔  so you don't miss any videos: http://goo.gl/0bsAjO 

When you think of CGI animated films, you likely think of Pixar. The studio practically invented the genre with 1995’s Toy Story — the first CGI animated feature film. 

After Toy Story, almost all animation studios wanted to follow in Pixar’s successful footsteps, straight down to their style. Many studios sought out “The Pixar Look”: extremely high quality, physically based, and in some cases almost photorealistic.

It’s an appealing approach that remains popular at the box office — but animated movies started looking kind of homogeneous. And while studios and independent artists tested out more stylized approaches in short films, no studio would commit to a feature-length animated movie that looked so different.

That is, until Sony Pictures/Imageworks took on Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse. Instead of chasing the look everyone was after, the team wanted to create something visually new. They did it with “non-photorealistic rendering.” 

And since Spider-Verse, non-photorealism has taken off, with almost every studio set to incorporate it in the next five years. Check out our video to learn more about how non-photorealism works.

Note: A version of this was previously published with a spelling error. The error has since been corrected.

In 2017, Egypt’s government announced it would build a new capital city 45 kilometers outside of Cairo, the current capital. It was a shocking announcement since Cairo, a city of more than 10,000,000 people, has been the capital of Egypt for decades. 

The government claims that Cairo has become too overcrowded and that moving the capital will give both Cairo’s residents and government workers more space. But this excuse is not new. For decades, Egypt’s rulers have been building brand new cities in the desert. None of them have solved Cairo’s density issue. And based on how construction is going, this new capital won’t be a solution either. 

So why does Egypt want a new capital? Well, it has a lot to do with the political revolution in 2011. 

Watch this episode of Vox Atlas to understand the real reason behind Egypt’s giant new capital city.

Mohamed Elshahed’s extensive expertise on architectural history and urbanism helped us understand why creating new cities and communities doesn’t actually improve livelihoods in Cairo:

If you know anything about beavers, it’s probably that they build dams. These giant structures made of sticks, stones, and mud can reach heights up to 10 feet (3 meters) and lengths averaging 20 feet (6 meters) — though the biggest one ever found was significantly larger and could be seen from space. Dams completely alter the surrounding landscape, flooding the surrounding area and creating wetlands. It’s one reason beavers have often been considered pests that can cause serious damage when they build dams too close to homes or roads.

But scientists have also understood beavers’ importance as “ecosystem engineers” for decades. And as the climate crisis continues to worsen, newer studies are finding that beavers play a vital role in dampening its effects — especially in areas prone to fire, drought, and even heat waves. To build a more resilient future, it might be best to look to the beavers.

Your TV finds lots of ways to adjust your picture. You might not want any of them.

Motion smoothing, sharpening, brightness, contrast, and saturation are all adjustments that your television makes to your picture. These can differ wildly from what filmmakers intend and, sometimes, that’s a nightmare.

As the above video shows, these adjustments are subtle but significant, especially when viewed alongside the original image. Fortunately, there is a solution — TV manufacturers have begun adopting new modes like “Filmmaker Mode,” which largely remove television tweaks to an image.

Henry Rogers' French impressionist paintings of Paris street scenes seem to only exist in online auctions and yard sales. The mystery of his identity deepens when you take a closer look at his art, and notice that his signature changes from painting to painting – sometimes it’s spelled “Henry” and sometimes the French “Henri.”

For years, the only place anyone could learn more about Rogers was on a blog called living-in-the-past.com — a site where one man documented his curiosities and passion projects, dating back to the ’90s.

The author of this site, Philip Lord, became obsessed with gathering information about Rogers but found nothing in his early online searches. So he started researching himself by analyzing dozens of Rogers’ paintings, many of them seeming to show the same street in Paris from varying perspectives. He wanted to figure out if “Henry Rogers” was a lone street painter in Paris, or in fact a workshop of painters trained to create similar-looking paintings and sign them under a pseudonym.

Lord gave up the search in 2011. In 2022, we picked up the puzzle and tried a few new avenues of inquiry. An actual Paris street painter told us that Rogers’ “impression” of Paris was imaginary. We visited a lab in Cleveland, Ohio, that uses artificial intelligence and detailed scans of paintings to distinguish the fingerprints of individual artists. They suggested that Henry Rogers is in fact multiple artists creating similar paintings.

As astronomers search for life outside our solar system, they have to try and answer one big question: What’s the recipe for a habitable planet? We tend to think about the ingredients we encounter every day: liquid water, the protective blanket of the atmosphere, a sun that is neither too warm nor too hot. But there are other factors that are probably equally important: Earth’s cooled and hardened crust, its gooey molten guts, its magnetic field, its volcanoes and deep sea vents. These are the features that fostered life as we know it – they were shaped by unseen processes hidden deep within the globe.

In short, if we want to learn how life could arise on other planets, we need to know what’s going on under the hood.

But that’s easier said than done. As you drill down into a planet, temperatures and pressures quickly rise. Scientists and their tools wouldn’t survive a few dozen miles down, let alone a few thousand. So how can they study the insides of planets?

Enter NIF and OMEGA – by some measure, the two largest lasers in the world. They inhabit large warehouse-style buildings, and focus scores of intense laser beams onto the head of a pin. When facilities like these were first imagined, the goal was to create nuclear fusion – but planetary scientists quickly realized they could be used to investigate matter under core-like conditions.

The last decade has seen a flood of experiments - and the results have been bizarre. Nickel, a metal that conducts electricity, turns into an insulator. Water forms a hot, conductive ice. Hydrogen becomes a metallic fluid. Sodium, normally a shiny opaque metal, goes completely clear. These startling insights are helping scientists understand how planets form, and how they might evolve to support life.

On any given day at the Hogeweyk, you can see locals wandering the streets, going out for coffee, folding laundry, and tending gardens, all surrounded by lush outdoor space. Located in Weesp, a Dutch city just outside Amsterdam, the Hogeweyk is a planned village intentionally designed for one purpose: maximizing quality of life for its 180 residents — all of whom have severe dementia. 

Inside, nurses and doctors don’t wear uniforms, meals are cooked inside the home with groceries from the village grocery store, and other Weesp residents are free to dine at the on-site restaurant. These design choices aim to deinstitutionalize senior living, blurring the line between what typically happens in front of residents and what happens out of sight. 

The style of care that this facility pioneered has been nicknamed the “dementia village,” and it’s been emulated across the world. It’s architecturally organized around choice; by giving residents a high level of freedom, its designers hope to minimize issues associated with dementia like aggression, confusion, and wandering.

In the 1950s, the US and Canada embarked on a massive project to widen the St. Lawrence River, transforming the region to facilitate commerce, attract industry, and boost both nations’ economies. But there was a third nation in the region whose people were not consulted, and whose lifestyle was completely transformed by the project: the Mohawk of Akwesasne.

The St. Lawrence River has been central to Mohawk culture in the region for thousands of years. The river’s fish form the central part of their diet. But for the Mohawk, the fish aren’t a “resource” to be used. They’re an equal partner in a relationship in which both humans and wildlife have sacred responsibilities to one another. These relationships are central to the Mohawk worldview, and they mirror similar ways of understanding the natural world in other Indigenous communities.

But the bid to lure industry to the region worked. Two major manufacturers built factories close to Akwesasne, and by the 1980s, the Mohawk learned that General Motors and Reynolds Metal had been poisoning the river for decades with cancer-causing chemicals called PCBs. Fish in the river were found to have extremely dangerous levels of PCBs. It presented the community with a devastating choice: continue to fish and risk health problems like cancer and thyroid disorders, or stop fishing and lose the connection with the river, and with their ancestors.

The full statement we received from Alcoa, owner of Reynolds Metals, is as follows:

“Today, Reynolds Metals Company and the U.S. EPA continue to monitor the various remediation solutions related to the St. Lawrence River and the historical operations from Reynolds Metals Company near Massena. The remediation work was designed in 2000, after public input and consultation, to protect human health and the environment. The work included dredging and capping portions of the river.

“In 2021, the U.S. EPA completed its fourth, five-year review of the remediation project.  EPA confirmed that the remediation work is effective and that it continues to protect human health and the environment.

“Alcoa Inc., the former parent company to Alcoa Corporation, acquired Reynolds Metals in 2000. In November of 2016, Alcoa Inc. separated into two companies, Arconic Inc. and Alcoa Corporation, and Reynolds was assigned to Alcoa Corporation.”

📣 If the news feels chaotic to you these days, you're not alone. We want to answer your biggest questions about what's happening in the world today via our new video format: https://forms.gle/Mgp2oqa3gr8tNw1M7 📣

“How come we’ve seen such a decline in unionization in the US?” That’s the question we received from one of our viewers, Cameron when we put out a call for topics to explain. It comes at an interesting time.

Earlier this year, the Amazon Labor Union won its first election at a large warehouse in New York, and more than 200 Starbucks locations have voted to unionize since baristas in Buffalo broke the seal in December 2021. The National Labor Relations Board reports that petitions for union elections are up 56 percent this year compared to 2021. 

This level of energy and momentum in the labor movement is remarkable in light of the long, steep decline in union membership rates since the 1950s. Social science has limited tools for establishing what caused that decline, and different experts tend to emphasize different factors. But in the video above, we dig into a few key drivers of low union density in the US relative to other wealthy countries.

For decades, drought-stricken areas around the world have practiced “cloud seeding,” a process where chemical flares full of silver iodide are shot into clouds to encourage them to rain. But until recently, the science didn’t quite back this practice up. In large part, that’s because operational cloud seeding programs don’t have the luxury of conducting controlled tests — they have an obligation to produce as much rain as possible for the people living under the clouds they seed. 

But there’s been a new breakthrough. In 2017, a major cloud seeding experiment in the mountains of Idaho showed that cloud seeding works; shooting chemical flares into the sky does produce more precipitation. 

As the world faces an increasing number of heat waves and droughts, banking water is becoming more and more important. And while we don’t know exactly how life-changing cloud seeding will turn out to be, we do know it has the potential to be a tool in our arsenal in the long battle against worsening droughts.

To understand how cloud seeding works and what it’s already doing in Texas, watch this video and take a trip up to the clouds to see it yourself.

Subscribe and turn on notifications (🔔) so you don't miss any videos: http://goo.gl/0bsAjO

Cars travel at their fastest speeds when moving in a straight line, and Formula 1 is no different. F1 racers drive at over 215 mph on the straightest parts of the track. But when it comes to turning around tight corners, these kinds of speeds just aren’t possible. In order to avoid spinning out and crashing, racers have to slow down and use physics to strategically craft the most efficient turns while retaining the greatest amount of speed, ideally giving them a leg up against the competition.

The most efficient path through any corner (or set of corners) is generally referred to as the “ideal racing line.”

This line changes depending on the path of the track before and after the curve, but the goal is always to spend as little time in the turn as possible. That means using the entire width of the track to minimize the angle that the car will take around the turn, ultimately allowing drivers to carry the most speed through it.

In 2008, voters in California passed Proposition 1A, giving the state the go-ahead to build a high-speed rail line. In theory, it was a great idea. The train would whisk passengers between San Francisco and Los Angeles in less than 3 hours. Eventually it would also link San Diego and Sacramento. It was estimated that it would take until 2020 to complete. 

But now it’s 2022, and so far California’s high-speed rail line is just a few concrete bridges and viaducts strewn across the rural Central Valley. Much of the plan had to be changed, redesigned, or even abandoned all together. Now the project is decades late and way over budget. And that isn’t just California’s problem. Because among the many factors that plagued the project, several are baked into the power structure of the US itself.

Watch the video above to understand just how difficult the US makes it to build infrastructure like California’s high-speed rail line.

Subscribe and turn on notifications 🔔  so you don't miss any videos: http://goo.gl/0bsAjO 

For decades, the US Congress failed to make meaningful movement on gun reform in the aftermath of mass shootings. But that weak federal response has obscured another story: that state gun laws change after mass shootings all the time. And a study found that, in Republican-controlled state legislatures, a mass shooting roughly doubles the number of laws loosening gun restrictions in the next year.

In this video we look at Texas, where decades of mass shootings in the US have been met with laws that expand gun access. We spoke with Flo Rice, a survivor of the 2018 Santa Fe High School shooting, where a gunman killed 10 people. Flo was shot six times. She and her husband, Scot, became advocates for gun safety, and tried to get tighter gun laws passed in Texas. Watch the piece above to see what happened, and what their story reveals about who has power when it comes to gun policy in the US.

In recent years, state legislatures in the US have introduced hundreds of bills targeting the rights of LGBTQ Americans. Many of those laws are focused in particular on the rights of transgender school children in public schools: what types of bathrooms they can use, whether their pronouns will be used, and whether they can participate in school sports. These laws are increasingly common in Republican-controlled states. Also, they may be violations of federal law.

This puts public schools in these states in a strange position: do they follow state laws that, under the Biden administration, could open them up to a federal civil rights investigation? Or do they ignore state law, and risk the state cutting their funding? Amid all that uncertainty, those who suffer most are the trans children caught up in the fight. 

This video focuses on how that battle is playing out in Tennessee, the state that has introduced more anti-LGBTQ laws in 2022 than almost any other state. We looked at two of the laws that target transgender public school kids: one about bathrooms and one about participation in school sports. Those two issues have very different legal contexts, which you can read more about in the links below.

A note about the data on bullying and school attendance that compares trans, nonbinary, and cisgender students: the sample size of this study is low, covering 14 states that included a question about gender identity, and it’s difficult to ascertain how many transgender students were surveyed in it: 
https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/69/su/su6901a1.htm#:~:text=In%20addition%2C%20although,and%20ethnicity%20data

Subscribe and turn on notifications 🔔  so you don't miss any videos: http://goo.gl/0bsAjO 

In June, the Supreme Court overturned the 1973 landmark decision Roe v. Wade — eliminating the federal right to abortion, and giving the power to decide whether abortion is a crime to each individual state. As of July, many states have already banned abortion outright, and more are soon to follow. But heavily restricting or banning abortion doesn’t eliminate the need for it. And abortion care looks a bit different than it did in 1973.

Over 50 percent of legal abortions in the United States are now carried out early in pregnancy with the use of a two-medication regime known as “abortion pills” or “medication abortion.” Most people are able to take the medication in the privacy of their own home.

In December 2021, the federal Food and Drug Administration permanently allowed the pills to be shipped by mail -- and even the states with the tightest restrictions don't necessarily have the power to stop the pills from being discreetly mailed to patients’ homes. And while doctors who live in states where abortion is banned can’t prescribe the pills for that purpose, people in those states are finding ways get them with the help of websites like PlanCPills.org. The video above outlines some of the paths they’re taking to get the care they need in a post-Roe America.

Some scientists once believed that the human brain was unchangeable and only declined with age. In the 1960s, neuroscientist Dr. Marian Diamond proved that this belief was false. Dr. Diamond, who famously studied the brain of Dr. Albert Einstein, proved that if the brain was in an enriched environment, it could grow and renew its connections.

One way humans can access an enriched environment? Travel.

Different brains’ synapses are sparked when humans are exposed to new foods, smells, tastes, and sensations within their environment. Traveling is one way humans can potentially develop new synaptic connections and transform archaic ways of comprehending.

Dr. Diamond found that the cerebral cortices of the rats in enriched environments were about six percent bigger than the rats in the bare cages. Also, the rats in the multi-sensory environment had more synaptic connections than those in the bare settings. This demonstrated that in order for the brain to be able to learn, strengthen and develop, it needs synapses connections.

Dr. Beau Lotto, who was mentored by Dr. Marian Diamond, elaborates on the significance of those connections: “What’s really important is to have a brain that has the ability to make connections and to lose them. In other words, it’s not about just adapting, it’s about becoming adaptable.”

In his book “Soft-Wired: How the New Science of Brain Plasticity Can Change Your Life,” Dr. Michael Merzenich explains the importance of getting outside of one’s comfort zone and embracing the unfamiliar. According to Merzenich, “people who travel to new places, keep learning languages, and continue to experience new things into old age, are far less likely to develop cognitive decay.”

Building on that theme, “travel and having new experiences, in general, is very beneficial for creativity because the more bits of information that you have, the more learning that you have,” says Dr. Shelley Carson, author of “Your Creative Brain: Seven Steps to Maximize Imagination, Productivity, and Innovation in Your Life.” To be more creative, a person needs to learn new things constantly. “Travel is one of the ways to constantly be learning because travel is full of new experiences, new stimuli, that’s just going to pack your brain full of new information,” says Dr. Carson.

Motion capture has taken over a lot of computer animation for movies, video games, and TV. Coverage typically focuses on actors wearing funny suits and performing feats of imagination. But is it really that easy?

The above video shows that it’s a lot more complex than that. Motion capture requires heavy editing, tweaking, and processing after the actual capture to create animations that look real. That part of the process is key to understanding the images on your screen.

In 2008, researchers with the University of California San Francisco embarked on a study that compared the outcomes of two similar groups of women, each at a crucial juncture in their lives: a visit to an abortion clinic. The groups differed, though, in whether or not they were able to terminate an unwanted pregnancy. It was called the Turnaway Study, named for those who were turned away by the clinic because their pregnancies were past legal gestational limits, and it provides some of the best data we have on the impacts of abortion bans. 

Among the study’s findings is the severe financial impact of being forced to parent a new child when someone is already living in difficult financial circumstances. People who seek abortions, especially later-term abortions, are far more likely than the general population to be living in poverty, or otherwise financially unstable. That fact makes it unsurprising that, when researchers asked women about their reasons for seeking an abortion, not being financially prepared was the most common reason. This video offers a glimpse into the financial penalty of parenting under difficult circumstances. 

We interviewed several women who had similar experiences to the women in the study. We didn’t seek out interviewees who exactly reflected the circumstances of the study participants (i.e., the length of gestation when they sought an abortion, or their socioeconomic background) but their stories reveal some parallels: most people want an abortion because they don’t feel financially stable or don’t have a partner they want to co-parent with. 

The Turnaway Study also looked at mental health outcomes, relationship outcomes, and whether or not study participants chose adoption instead of parenting. Whether or not they chose adoption is relevant to common pro-life rhetoric, which encourages people to give unwanted children up for adoption rather than choose abortion. But the Turnaway Study found that 91% of women who were denied an abortion chose to parent, which indicates that adoption is not a feasible alternative for most people. We interviewed Gretchen Sisson, a researcher who looked at adoption rates and motivations among the Turnaway Study participants.

The Amazon has always been one of the most mysterious places on earth. 

When European colonizers arrived in the 16th century, they were captivated by rumors of a golden city, hidden somewhere in the rainforest. Their search for “El Dorado” lasted more than a century, but only resulted in disaster, death, and further conquest of the indigenous people there. 

Experts thereafter looked at the Amazon and saw only a desolate jungle; too harsh for extensive agriculture and therefore sparsely populated. They believed that it had always been this way. 

Until recently. 

Beginning in the late 20th century, archaeologists began looking more closely at the forest floor. Working with the indigenous people who still remained there, they excavated long ditches and mounds. After mapping them, they could see that these were the markings of large settlements; walls, moats, plazas, and roads that connected even more settlements. And they were all over the Amazon.

Drag kings have historically gotten a lot less attention than drag queens, but that’s starting to change. We interviewed five drag kings about their relationships to drag, how the artform has transformed, and what they love about it. 

In the words of King Molasses, drag is full of “that swag you get in the shower that nobody sees.” Drag king performances are all about playing with masculine identities: politicizing them, satirizing them, and having fun with them. And these performers have been around for centuries. 

In China, documentation of “male impersonators” dates back to the Tang Dynasty, from 618 to 907 AD. In the mid-to-late 1800s, drag king pioneers like Annie Hindle, Vesta Tilley, and Ella Wesner began performing. And in the early 1900s, Go-won-go Mohawk was likely the first indigenous male impersonator. 

By the early 1900s, black performers like Gladys Bentley and Stormé DeLarverie were becoming drag pioneers. And by the 1990s, there was a big, thriving drag king scene in cities like New York City, San Francisco, and London — all over the world. 

Today, drag kings are pushing for space in a cis male-dominated field. And it’s working.

If you’ve ever been on a modern looping roller coaster, you’ve probably experienced a thrilling, safe, and mostly comfortable ride. But this wasn’t always the case. Just over 100 years ago, loop-the-loops were painful, not sturdy, and much more dangerous than they are today.

Between the 1840s and early 1900s, loops on roller coasters were perfectly circular — meaning riders would go from traveling in a fairly straight line to immediately moving into a curve. This rapid onset of curvature caused extreme G force spikes that rattled passengers to their core.  

The first looping roller coaster in North America — Coney Island’s Flip-Flap Railway — could exert up to 14 G's on a person. For reference, astronauts in a spaceship launch experience 3 G’s. Fighter pilots with very special equipment and training can handle 10 G’s for short periods of time. 14 G’s was (and still is) tremendous.

More people paid to watch others ride these early coasters rather than ride themselves. Without sustained success, most looping coasters closed down within their first decade of operation.

Looping coasters wouldn’t find success again until the 1970s with a new loop shape, new materials, many more cars — and, thankfully, fewer G’s. In this video, we break down all the advancements that helped make looping coasters the popular ride they are today.

Shipping container homes have been a trend for a while, from reality TV shows to housing policy discussions. But the truth is that these homes are a lot more difficult to build than you might think.

It’s easy to think that housing solutions are purely technological, but many obstacles to housing aren’t in construction but in the policies surrounding homebuilding. Moreover, many of the supposed advantages of shipping containers turn out to be more complicated in reality.

Vox’s Phil Edwards spent a night in a shipping container home to see how the experience of staying in a shipping container compares with the reality of building one.

Subscribe and turn on notifications 🔔 so you don't miss any videos: http://goo.gl/0bsAjO 

Beginning in January 2021, advances in AI research have produced a plethora of deep-learning models capable of generating original images from simple text prompts, effectively extending the human imagination. Researchers at OpenAI, Google, Facebook, and others have developed text-to-image tools that they have not yet released to the public, and similar models have proliferated online in the open-source arena and at smaller companies like Midjourney.

These tools represent a massive cultural shift because they remove the requirement for technical labor from the process of image-making. Instead, they select for creative ideation, skillful use of language, and curatorial taste. The ultimate consequences are difficult to predict, but — like the invention of the camera, and the digital camera thereafter — these algorithms herald a new, democratized form of expression that will commence another explosion in the volume of imagery produced by humans. But, like other automated systems trained on historical data and internet images, they also come with risks that have not been resolved. 

The video above is a primer on how we got here, how this technology works, and some of the implications. And for an extended discussion about what this means for human artists, designers, and illustrators, check out this bonus video: https://youtu.be/sFBfrZ-N3G4

It’s no secret that TikTok is a virality machine. Songs get turned into sounds that can be used in any video, and if they gain enough traction they can catapult a musician into the pop culture stratosphere. But we wanted to know exactly what happens between a song going viral and an artist becoming a bonafide success. So in the fall of 2021, we partnered with data analysis website The Pudding figure it out. 

Along the way, we discovered that using data to concretely answer this question is quite a challenge. Our process included creating dozens of custom data sets, careful fact-checking, and conversations with both hit songwriters and music industry executives to match data with real experiences. 

After seven months of spreadsheets, data deep-dives, and interviews, we were able to follow the numbers to track what happens to artists after they go viral — and how the music industry has shapeshifted around TikTok. It turns out the app is completely revolutionizing the way record labels work, and giving artists more leverage than ever.

Since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, the EU has sanctioned much of Russia’s economy, but Russia’s natural gas trade remains untouched. The EU gets nearly a quarter of its energy from natural gas, and almost half of that comes from Russia, the world’s largest gas exporter. As the EU’s largest economy, Germany is Russia’s biggest customer, paying Russia’s state-owned gas company 200 million euros. So while Germany has even sent Ukraine weapons, in a historic shift of military policy, through its gas supply Germany is helping to pay for the war it’s trying to stop.

It’s inherently hard to pivot away from piped gas. Unlike oil and coal, which can be rerouted, gas pipelines cost billions, take years to build, and physically connect producer and buyer directly, making them long-term commitments. That was the origin of Germany’s dependence on Russian gas, and over time it’s only deepened. Today, as the world tries to punish Russia through sanctions, that dependence is getting in the way.

Centuries before we had American Sign Language, Native sign languages, broadly known as “Hand Talk,” were thriving across North America. Hand Talk would be influential in the formation of American Sign Language. But it has largely been written out of history. 

One of these Hand Talk variations, Plains Indian Sign Language, was used so widely across the Great Plains that it became a lingua franca — a universal language used by both deaf and hearing people to communicate among tribes that didn’t share a common spoken language. At one point, tens of thousands of indigenous people used Plains Indian Sign Language, or PISL, for everything from trade to hunting, conflict, storytelling, and rituals.  

But by the late 1800s, the federal government had implemented a policy that would change the course of indigenous history forever: a violent boarding school program designed to forcibly assimilate indigenous children into white American culture — a dark history that we’re still learning more about to this day. 

Because of a forced “English-only” policy, the boarding school era is one of the main reasons we lost so many Native signers — along with the eventual dominance of ASL in schools for the deaf. 

Today, there are just a handful of fluent PISL signers left in the US. In the piece above we hear from two of these signers who have dedicated their lives to studying and revitalizing the language. They show us PISL in action, and help us explore how this ancient language holds centuries of indigenous history. 

Note: The headline on this piece has been updated.
Previous headline: Before American Sign Language, we had ""Hand Talk""

Nazaré, Portugal was for centuries just a small fishing village known for its fishermen and dangerous seas. Then one day in 2011, a pro-surfer named Garrett McNamara strapped on a surf board and rode a 78 foot wave right off its coast. It was a new world-record for big wave surfing and the moment that changed Nazaré forever. Now, Nazaré is the capital of Big Wave surfing. The secret to Nazaré’s giant waves lies under the surface, where a huge underwater canyon funnels swells right up to its cliffs, then launches that energy straight up, sometimes 60, 70, or 80 feet. Many surfers visit in the hopes of catching a 100-foot wave.

Deep in the Sahara, far from any towns, roads, or other signs of life, is a row of markings in the sand. There are dozens of them stretching for miles in a straight line in central Algeria, each consisting of a central point surrounded by a circle of 12 nodes, like numbers on a clock. And when we started making this video, no one seemed to know what they were. 

We first saw the circles back in September 2021, after finding a Reddit post on r/WhatIsThis with coordinates asking what the circles could be. With just two upvotes and two commenters, it wasn’t exactly a lively discussion. But seeing the circles themselves on Google Earth was fascinating: They were eerily perfect in their shape and regularity, but so deeply isolated in the desert. We were hooked on finding an answer. 

So we decided to make a video out of trying to solve the mystery, no matter where it took us. We documented every step of the process — from Zoom calls and web browser screen recordings to vlogs and field shoots — to show the reporting process from the inside out. And when we maxed out what we could learn on the internet, we handed over this story to a team in Algeria to take it all the way.

Frank Lloyd Wright’s Usonian homes included many distinctive features, from the brick and cedar materials to the open floor plan. But one of the most distinctive features might be the windows — which reflected his broader philosophy of natural light.

As the above video shows, Wright considered natural light an important part of the house that deserved highlighting, both in the windows used and in the way the rest of the house showcased that light. The Pope-Leighey house in Alexandria, Virginia, is a particularly good showcase of the way these windows made natural light an integral part of the home.

Further Reading:
Steven M. Reiss’s book about the Pope-Leighey House is an invaluable resource for learning about the house, but it also gives a peek into the development process of a Frank Lloyd Wright home.

Subscribe and turn on notifications 🔔 so you don't miss any videos: http://goo.gl/0bsAjO 

Russian gymnast Ivan Kuliak caused controversy in March 2022 when he accepted a bronze medal at a World Cup event, all while sporting a taped-on letter “Z” on his uniform. The Z symbol had already been appearing all over Russia, as a sign of support for the Russian invasion of Ukraine and loyalty to Russian President Vladimir Putin. The letter popped up on merchandise, in highly organized flash mobs that often involved children, at pro-war rallies, and in internet memes.

The symbol was originally spotted on Russian tanks and trucks building up at Ukraine’s border in late February, along with other letters like V and O. Questions about what the symbols meant began circulating online, and once the invasion began on February 24, most analysts agreed the markings were likely for tactical purposes.

But as intrigue around them grew, the Russian Defense Ministry seized on the opportunity to claim that the letters carry extra meaning. They began generating memes that incorporated the Z and V into propaganda slogans. Those letters don’t appear in Russia’s Cyrillic alphabet, so some of the memes Latinize them: most common are ones that begin with the word “for” — spelled “Зa” in Russian, but Latinized to “Za” for the memes. 

Another way Putin’s regime has turned Z into a propaganda meme has been by connecting it with the Soviet victory over Nazi Germany in World War II. The “Great Patriotic War” maintains a significant presence in Russian culture — the anniversary of Germany’s defeat is celebrated each year on May 9, or ""Victory Day,"" and World War II imagery is heavily associated with Russian patriotism and national pride. Z memes that incorporate old photos of Soviet soldiers — and the recognizable orange and black stripes of the Ribbon of St. George — are an attempt to equate the current war in Ukraine with World War II. 

The Z has spread beyond Russia, too. It’s now seen in pro-Russian demonstrations worldwide and is banned in a growing list of countries. The Z’s evolution from tactical markings on invasion vehicles to a global pro-war symbol demonstrates the effectiveness of the Putin regime’s propaganda strategies.

Correction: A previous version of this video showed a photo at 4:06 of graffiti in Vologograd which depicted a satirical use of ""Z"" slogans. We have changed the image to a graffitied ""Z"" in St. Petersburg instead.

Subscribe and turn on notifications 🔔 so you don't miss any videos: http://goo.gl/0bsAjO 

In Ukraine, human rights investigators like Amnesty International and Bellingcat have been tracking Russian attacks to aid in a potential war crimes investigation. One thing they’re paying special attention to is cluster bombs. Cluster bombs were first used in World War II; they scatter numerous smaller bombs over a wide area — often killing civilians. It’s this indiscriminate nature that often makes their use a war crime.

Our modern conception of war crimes was created by a series of treaties spanning decades. In 1977, one of those treaties banned what’s known as “indiscriminate attacks.” That means militaries are legally prohibited from attacking an area imprecisely, in a way that can harm civilians. 

Russia is not alone in using these weapons: In conflicts since the 1977 treaty, many militaries continue using them in civilian areas, with impunity, including the US. This video explains how they’re being used by Russia, and why places like the US and Russia just won’t give them up.

The International Space Station has been orbiting above us for the last 20 years. It’s been home to astronauts from more than a dozen different countries — but mostly Americans and Russians. The two former “Space Race” countries control the main parts of the station. The science done there has required close collaboration and so it’s been largely insulated from politics on Earth.

But Russia’s invasion of Ukraine may change that. The two countries have agreed to cooperate through 2024… but after that, the future of the space station is uncertain.

Despite the fact that it’s a war crime to target cultural heritage, cultural sites are often treated as a second front: looted, damaged, or destroyed as a way for an aggressor to assert power, demoralize an enemy, and control — or even erase — a cultural narrative. 

From the very beginning of the Russian invasion of Ukraine, identity has been at the center of Putin’s agenda. And as cultural sites all over the country sustain damage, it is becoming increasingly clear that erasing the cultural and historical markers of Ukraine are a key facet of Russia’s plan. 

Ukraine is home to a vast array of visual and material culture — museums, monuments, archives, and architecture — all of which is at grave risk of destruction, both collateral and intentional.  

We spoke with three experts actively working to safeguard Ukraine’s artistic treasures:

If your internet overlaps even a little bit with mine, you’ve seen a Cesca (also known as a B32). The cantilevered cane and chrome chair is all over the place: in trendy homes, on movies and tv sets, even tattooed on people's bodies. But Instagram’s favorite chair is not exactly new. 

It was designed nearly 100 years ago by an architect named Marcel Breuer, while he was a student at the Bauhaus, the famed German art school. This somewhat unassuming two-legged chair is the realization of a manifestos-worth of utopian ideals about design and functionality. So maybe it’s no surprise it has somehow remained in fashion for decades: It’s a design icon. And just a really, really nice looking chair.

In September 2021, China banned the import of sugar apples, or atemoya, from Taiwan, claiming they were bringing in pests. Critics say pests are an excuse, and China is weaponizing trade with Taiwan. And this isn’t the first time. In February of 2021, China banned the import of Taiwanese pineapples, causing a backlog and threatening farmers' livelihoods across the country. 

The current situation is tied to a complex history that goes back to the Chinese civil war, and to recent tensions that go back to 2016, when Taiwan elected a new president. Since then, Chinese military incursions into Taiwan’s air space have been on the rise, and the relation between the two has kept deteriorating. Fruit is the latest expression of this. 

To understand how this atemoya ban impacts farmers in Taiwan, and how it all ties together, watch our video.

Why aren’t homes made of steel? In the late 1940s, one company posed that question. Lustron was a prefabricated home that was supposed to be the future of housing. So why did it fail?

For just a few years — 1947 to 1950 — the Columbus, Ohio-based Lustron represented the future of housing. Using a steel frame and porcelain enamel-covered steel panels, Lustron made homes in a factory and shipped them around the country.

Vox’s Phil Edwards visited a Lustron home just outside Dayton, Ohio, to experience the unusual features, like magnetic walls, for himself. This home’s quirks weren’t relegated to the materials. Through a combination of government funding sources, an attempt to reinvent the production cycle for home, and a unique distribution plan, the Lustron home helps explain how housing does — and doesn’t — work in America.

In Ukraine, it’s become known as “the Holodomor,” meaning “death by starvation.” It was a genocide carried out by a dictator who wanted to keep Ukraine under his control and who would do anything to keep it covered up for decades. 

In the 1930s, Soviet leaders under Joseph Stalin engineered a famine that killed millions as they sought to consolidate agricultural power. In Ukraine, they used additional force as they sought to clamp down on a burgeoning Ukrainian national identity. There, at least 4 million died. As hunger spread among residents, Stalin spearheaded a disinformation campaign to hide the truth from other Soviet citizens and the world. So many Ukrainians died that officials had to send people to resettle the area, setting off demographic shifts that last to this day.

On June 9, 1995, Batman Forever introduced audiences to what was likely the first CGI stunt double. 

In a few brief shots, a digital double lept from tall buildings and swung on a grappling hook, and was used to convince viewers that Bruce Wayne was more “super” than the average man. Since then, superheroes and digidoubles have gone hand in hand. Protagonists in superhero films often wear masks or skin-tight bodysuits, which makes them perfect candidates for digital replacement; fabric is way easier to replicate digitally than skin.  

Technology has only improved over the years, which means digidoubles are used for so much more than just “super” sequences. Today, digidoubles are used to give filmmakers and artists flexibility. Instead of being locked into what they’re able to shoot during principal photography, they can add and remove shots, completely change characters' costumes, and rewrite the script if they need to — long after filming is over.

The video above breaks down some surprising uses of digidoubles in superhero movies — and shows just how often they appear in modern movies. 

Correction: At 6:18, we mistakenly labeled Avengers: Infinity War as Avengers: Endgame.

Since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine began on February 24, more than 3 million people have been forced to flee their homes and leave the country. The vast majority are migrating west, toward the EU, and most are ending up in neighboring Poland. To escape the violence of the ground more than 2 million refugees have escaped by train, turning Ukraine’s railroad network into a vital lifeline. 

We sent a crew out to Przemyśl, a small Polish town on the border with Ukraine, to speak with the people who have fled Ukraine and left everything behind. In this video, we share their stories and take a look at how the railroad is operating in a war-torn country. To help us understand what a difficult operation this is, we spoke to the CEO of Ukrainian Railways, Oleksandr Kamyshin, who is running a mobile command unit to ensure Ukrainians can board trains and get to safety.

To hear their stories and understand the arduous journey many make by rail, watch our video.

Face masks were one of our earliest interventions to slow the spread of Covid-19. For two years we’ve largely relied on local governments and businesses to tell us when and where to wear them, but now those mandates are being lifted. So is it actually safe to take off the masks for good?  

It depends on who you are and where you are. Cases are dropping in many places around the world after a harsh omicron surge, but some countries are still fighting off deadly waves of the virus. Many public health experts are warning that the pandemic isn’t over yet, even if it feels like it is to some of us. It’s a good idea to hang onto your mask for now, but that doesn’t mean you have to wear it every day for the rest of your life, just that you should take a few key things into consideration. Check out the video above to learn more about risk mitigation as we weather the third year of a pandemic.

Subscribe and turn on notifications 🔔  so you don't miss any videos: http://goo.gl/0bsAjO 

The Russian air force is huge. Ukraine’s is not. And yet, more than two weeks into Russia’s war in Ukraine, one of the biggest surprises was that Russia had not yet achieved control of the skies over Ukraine, or what’s called “air superiority.” When a military has air superiority, its planes can attack the enemy much more easily and its ground troops can advance much faster. If, or when, Russia achieves air superiority, it will have gained a major advantage in the war.

To prevent or slow down that outcome, Ukraine’s allies in the west are working to deny Russia air superiority, mostly by sending weapons that can be used to shoot down planes. But Ukraine itself has asked for a more drastic step: the declaration of a no-fly zone over Ukraine, which would prohibit Russian planes from the airspace. But a no-fly zone is complicated, because to be effective, it has to be enforced. And the consequences of how that enforcement would play out could bring the war to places that were once unthinkable.

Once known for his political comedy sketches and skits where he pretended to play the piano with his penis, Volodymyr Zelenskyy was elected as the president of Ukraine in 2019 in a landslide victory. 

Although he promised that his presidency would be different from other Ukrainian leaders who “promise a lot” yet “do nothing,” President Zelenskyy would soon find himself unpopular with the public. Within two years, he had already navigated scandals like his offshore companies appearing in the Pandora Papers and struggled to fulfill his campaign pledge to end the war against Russia in the Donbas region of Ukraine.

But the Russian invasion on February 24, 2022, found him extremely well-positioned to offer his skills in performance and storytelling to motivate Ukrainians, rally Europe, and undermine Putin’s propaganda. How will his reaction to Russia’s advances affect his legacy?

We chose 8 clips that we feel explain President Zelenskyy’s rise from a comedian to the leader of Ukraine and had journalists and experts respond.

On February 24th, Russia launched a military invasion of Ukraine. Russian President Vladimir Putin called it a “special military operation,” but the scale of the attack shows this is a full-scale war that has already caused more than 100 casualties and forced more than half a million Ukrainians to flee their homes.

Ukraine and Russia’s conflict goes back to 2014, when Russia invaded and annexed Crimea and Russian-backed separatist forces took over parts of southeastern Ukraine’s Donbas region. But to understand the full context behind the invasion, it’s important to go even farther back, to the time when Europe’s current-day divisions began, and see how that shaped Europe’s power balance today.

President Donald Trump presided over the fastest vaccine development process in history, leading to abundant, free vaccines in the US by the spring of 2021. Although the mRNA Covid-19 vaccines haven’t been able to stop transmission of the virus, they have been highly effective against hospitalization and death, saving hundreds of thousands of lives and rendering the majority of new Covid-19 deaths preventable.

Trump has received three doses of the vaccine. But many of his most dedicated supporters have refused, and many have died as a result. Why? Obvious culprits include misinformation on social media and Fox News and the election of Joe Biden, which placed a Democrat at the top of the US government throughout the vaccine distribution period. But if you look closely at the data, you’ll see that vaccine-hesitant conservatives largely made up their mind well before the vaccines were available and before Donald Trump lost the 2020 election. 

To understand why, I took a deep dive into the data, interviewed researchers, and spoke to people who lost loved ones to preventable severe Covid-19 infections. What I found is a stark cautionary tale for the country and for Republican political elites. Partisan polarization takes on a life of its own; once set into motion it’s nearly impossible to stop, even when the fallout is immense and irreparable.

Every other high-income country in the world has a paid maternity leave policy. Most have a paternity leave policy, too. And usually some form of universal or subsidized child care for all families. The United States has… none of these policies. 

It did have federally-funded child care once. And Congress even passed a universal child care policy in the 70s. But today, the US is stuck on a policy path of welfare and tax credits. So… why hasn’t the US been able to establish these common family policies?

Subscribe and turn on notifications 🔔  so you don't miss any videos: http://goo.gl/0bsAjO 

When many people look at new housing construction, they don’t just see boxy, modern, and bland architecture. They see new buildings that symbolize displacement and gentrification, or the idea that the construction comes at the cost of pushing existing residents out and replacing them with richer, whiter residents. But as Vox policy reporter Jerusalem Demsas explains, new construction in the US can actually help fight displacement. 

There’s a growing body of research on what actually happens when we add units of housing to neighborhoods: market-rate units decrease displacement and rents in neighborhoods, while adding strictly affordable units decreases gentrification.  And while people may not love the aesthetics of the new architecture, these buildings all look so similar for a reason: it’s the cheapest way to build, at a time when the US needs more housing quickly. 

Watch the video above to find out more from Jerusalem Demsas on what these new buildings really mean for neighborhoods across the country, and how more construction — along with policies like rental assistance — can help the US housing crisis.

Subscribe and turn on notifications 🔔 so you don't miss any videos: http://goo.gl/0bsAjO 

In recent years, the sliding community — made up of skeleton, bobsleigh, and luge athletes — has experienced a spate of brain injury-related tragedy. At first glance, the reason why seems obvious: Sleds regularly reach speeds that top 90 miles per hour, and crashes are unfortunately very common.

But there is growing research that shows it might be the act of sledding itself that is the main driver of brain injury. With every run, athletes are exposed to immense force and vibration, causing micro-concussions that can ultimately add up to major damage. Those concussions are mild enough that they can go undiagnosed. But among sledding athletes the symptoms that indicate a micro-concussion — headaches, dizziness, etc. — are so common they have a special nickname, “sled head.”

There’s a lot science still doesn’t know about sled head and the brain in general. But from what we can tell, it’s pretty clear that sliding sports put the brain health of athletes at risk. 

Further reading:
When researching this piece, I spoke with the German skeleton team’s coach, Mark Wood. He’s working with Christina and Peter to push for research and regulation that might protect sliding athletes in the future. He wrote a great essay sharing his perspective on the sport and its dangers here: https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/head-first-safe-the-sport-skeleton-mark-wood-mbe/ 

Peter, Christina, Mark and neuropsychologist Aliyah Snyder are currently developing a survey surrounding sliding athlete's concussion and injury histories. It's not yet available, but if you’re a current or former sliding athlete looking to find out more, email asnyder@mednet.UCLA.edu

Italy’s land border cuts through the highest altitudes of the Alps — crossing snowfields, mountain peaks, and massive glaciers. For centuries, the watershed line (which marks the divide where water flows either north or south off of the mountains) served as a natural boundary between Italy and its European neighbors. But beginning in the 1980s, geographic surveyors noticed something: The glaciers whose peaks had long marked the watershed line were retreating … and moving Italy’s border along with them. 

The only inhabited place nearby — an Italian ski lodge called the Rifugio Guide del Cervino — was caught right in the middle. Since then, Italy, Switzerland, and Austria have piloted a new kind of “mobile border” agreement, where boundary lines move with the changing landscape. Their solution might prove crucial as climate change reshapes water-based borders around the world.

Correction: the watershed line at 00:41 was mislabeled and drawn incorrectly. We’ve fixed the error to reflect the correct watershed boundaries.

Bobsledding (or bobsleighing) is one of the oldest Olympic sports, dating back to the very first Winter Games in 1924. Back then, women were barred from competing in nearly every event except figure skating. Of the 250 athletes that arrived for the first Winter Olympics, only 11 were women. 

Times have changed, of course. The Winter Olympics in Beijing is considered the most sex-balanced to date, with female athletes making up 45 percent of the roster. But sexist regulations and outdated “science” still creep in. Who could forget the 2021 Summer Olympics, the questionable testosterone tests that barred female sprinters from competing in an event? As recently as 2008, the Winter Olympics was riddled with controversy over gender inclusion issues; female aerial skiers sued the Vancouver Organizing Committee over alleged discrimination. In 2005, the president of the International Ski Federation stated that ski jumping ""seems not to be appropriate for ladies from a medical point of view.""

Uteruses, am I right?

As for bobsledding, it wasn’t until 2002 that female athletes were invited to participate in the games, but only in a single event — the two-women bob. Since 1932, men have had two events (the two-men and four-men bob). In 2022, a new all-women bobsledding event was introduced: the monobob, a single-person sled, but is it actually leveling the playing field? Maybe, but not entirely in the way you might think.

To the layperson, watching a short track speed skating race is awe-inspiring — but it’s difficult to decipher the strategy guiding all the jostling around the rink. Behind the superhuman turns and sprints are calculated moves to control the pack. 

Apolo Ohno is probably being humble when he says that he was not the fastest skater when he entered the 500m short track finals at the 2006 Winter Olympics in Turin, Italy. But he makes that claim to emphasize the strategy — and the little bit of luck — that played into that gold medal win. That’s why he has always referred to that event as the “perfect race” in short track speed skating.  

I learned a lot from retired US Olympic speed skater John Coyle’s website, and I interviewed John for this story.
https://johnkcoyle.com/blog/2010/02/13/vancouver-journal-7-an-introduction-to-short-track-speedskating

I also learned a lot from former US Olympic speed skating coach Sue Ellis’s website:

The New York Times covered the way short track speed skaters bodies are shaped, because of the constant counterclockwise turns:

tWsSa9VtmTw,Vox,UCLXo7UDZvByw2ixzpQCufnA,Why ski jumpers hold their skis in a V,2022-02-07 13:00:36+00:00,"It’s more about aerodynamics than aesthetics.

If you looked at photos of ski jumpers today and ski jumpers 50 years ago, you’d notice one big difference.

In the past, jumpers held their skis tightly underneath their body in a parallel position. Keeping the body in a straight line like this was considered elegant and appealing. But more importantly, it was the position jumpers used to gather as much distance as possible. This position made athletes thin and small, which allowed them to move forward through the air quickly. However, the parallel position didn’t do much to help them fight gravity.

In the 1980s, ski jumper Jan Boklov tested out a different ski position — one that resembled a V. He noticed that the V shape allowed him to achieve longer distances.

That’s because, unlike the parallel position, the V position allows air to hit athletes' bodies directly. Instead of cutting through the air quickly, they’re using their body to catch air like a wing. This extra air lifts athletes up, allowing them to stay airborne longer — and go further. This small change revolutionized the sport, and since then, gold medal winners have used the V style to make it to the podium.

In the mid-1800s, the development of exciting new forms of communication, like photography and the telegraph, was considered miraculous. This technology also coincided with a new religious movement becoming popular in the US and Europe: spiritualism. Spiritualists believed that, through the use of a medium, contact with the dead was possible. During the bloody American Civil War (1861-1865), belief in Spiritualism grew.

It was during this time that William Mumler, an amateur photographer in Boston, claimed he could photograph ghosts. He and his wife Hannah, herself a professional photographer and Spiritualist medium, created a stir in Boston by selling these ""spirit portraits,"" and attracted the attention of Spiritualists and skeptics alike. Professional photographers in Boston investigated Mumler's method again and again but couldn't figure out how he did his trick.

After accusations of fraud piled up in Boston, the Mumler’s relocated to New York City, the photographic capital of the US. Here, Mumler was quickly arrested on fraud charges, and his trial was sensationalized in New York newspapers. The prosecution even brought in circus showman P.T. Barnum to testify against Mumler. But, like the photographers in Boston, no one could confidently identify his method — and Mumler was acquitted.

Once the trial was over, the Mumlers' spirit photography business boomed. They photographed prominent Americans, including Mary Todd Lincoln and William Lloyd Garrison, and even took mail-in orders from people who couldn't visit their studio in Boston. We visited photographic process historian Mark Osterman to demonstrate how Mumler could have used two negatives, printed simultaneously with a bit of sleight of hand, to fool witnesses into believing his ""ghosts"" were the real thing.

Our director of photography in Annapolis, Maryland, was Colin Faust.

Today, it’s easy to take big glass windows and doors for granted, whether they show up in commercial buildings or in our homes. But this use of glass is, at its core, a technological breakthrough that changed how we live and how our buildings work.

As Thomas Leslie explains, insulated glass shaped the look of the 20th century. Big but poorly insulated glass windows went out of fashion as electricity allowed for the production of artificial light. Builders needed a new way to install windows that let in natural light, but also controlled heat.

Insulated glass was that solution. As the above video shows, the invention of a branded glass, Thermopane, and its immediate competitors, led to the landscape we recognize today.

In 2002, the US opened a prison at its naval base in Guantánamo bay, Cuba. The 9/11 attacks had occurred just months before, and the US was capturing hundreds of men in Afghanistan and Pakistan. It wanted a place to hold and question them. So the Bush administration opened Guantánamo and claimed that it lay outside of US and international law. 

The detainees didn’t have to be charged with a crime to be imprisoned and the US could hold them as long as they’d like. By 2003, there were nearly 700 men imprisoned in Guantánamo, but there was backlash from around the world. When Barack Obama took office in 2009, he pledged to close Guantánamo. 

But politics quickly got in the way. He was able to decrease the population but faced legal challenges. Ultimately, no president has been able to close Guantánamo because once something is created outside the law, its impossible to bring it back inside the law.

Subscribe and turn on notifications 🔔  so you don't miss any videos: http://goo.gl/0bsAjO 

For a tour of some of the odd exoplanets scientists have found, watch part one, here: https://youtu.be/lrAFaONyLtU 

Pluto was discovered in January of 1930, a tiny speck on a photographic plate (https://www.planetary.org/space-images/the-pluto-discovery-plates). It was the most distant world humans had ever seen. Decades later, even the powerful Hubble Space Telescope struggled to get a good look at the dwarf planet – the Hubble image of Pluto is just a sickly yellow smudge (https://esahubble.org/images/opo1006h/). 

So when astronomers set out to search for planets around other stars (aka “exoplanets), they knew it wouldn’t be easy. Our closest neighbor, a little red dwarf named Proxima Centauri, is 7,000 times further away from us than Pluto. Any planets in orbit around it would likely get lost in the glare of bright starlight.

“Trying to see an earthlike planet across interstellar distances,” writes astrophysicist Adam Frank, “would be like looking from New York City to AT&T Park in San Francisco, where the Giants play, and making out a firefly next to one of the stadium spotlights.”

“To detect or study an exoplanet,” says Sara Seager, a planet-hunting astrophysicist at MIT, “we have to work with the star.”

Astronomers started monitoring stars for tiny changes that could hint at the presence of one or more planets. Early efforts focused on the search for a wobble. The pull of a planet’s gravity causes a star to circle their mutual center of gravity - and from our vantage point the star seems to swing back and forth. In 1995, a Swiss team picked up the signature of just such a wobble in the starlight from a yellow dwarf in the Pegasus constellation. They had found 51-Pegasi b: the first exoplanet around a sun-like star.

Over the next few decades, astrophysicists honed a whole range of planet-hunting tools. They learned to spot the way planets can change the shape of their stars, how a planet’s gravity can bend light, and the periodic drop in brightness when a planet passes between its star and Earth. Telescopes have become more precise and powerful, and computers have become better at sifting out signal from noise. Today, we’re closing in on 5,000 known exoplanets (https://exoplanetarchive.ipac.caltech.edu/).

Fifty years ago, astronomers had no idea what percentage of stars had planets. A common educated guess was 20%, but for all we knew it could have been zero. But based on what we’ve seen since, it seems possible that every star has at least one planetary companion. 

Now that we know exoplanets exist, it’s time to learn more about them. What are they made of? How did they form? And, most tantalizing, could they harbor life? We’re like sailors who have spotted a tiny rise of land on the horizon. Now we want to study this new island’s geology and biology and make contact with any inhabitants … but we have to do it all from aboard our ship, floating trillions of miles out at sea.

Watch part 2, How to find a planet you can't see, here: https://youtu.be/STsI6IbPbGQ

In 1584, Italian friar Giordano Bruno argued that other stars had planets of their own and that those planets had inhabitants. He had no real proof of his claims — they just felt true. But they were heretical enough to get the attention of the Roman Catholic Church. The Inquisition arrested Bruno, put his tongue in a vice, and burned him at the stake.

Four hundred years later, the idea of “exoplanets” (the term for planets outside our solar system) had become much more popular. Books, TV, and movies teemed with alien worlds orbiting alien suns. But one thing remained the same. We still had no proof that they existed.

Then, in 1995, astronomers discovered 51 Pegasi b — a planet orbiting a sun-like star in the Pegasus constellation. Many scientists were skeptical at first; this planet was almost too strange to be believed. Though it was about the size of Jupiter, it was closer to its star than Mercury is to our sun. Most surprisingly, it completed its orbit in just 4 days. 

The years that followed brought a trickle of other discoveries, then a flood. New telescopes were sent to space and new computers crunched the data they collected. Today, we’ve confirmed the existence of nearly 5,000 exoplanets, with many more candidates waiting in the wings. Those planets paint a surprising picture of our galaxy. While astronomers once wondered if any stars have planets - now planetary systems seem the norm. 51 Pegasi b wasn’t a fluke — gas giants zipping around close to their stars (nicknamed “Hot Jupiters” or “Roasters”) are actually very common. We’ve also found lots of “super earths” — rocky worlds 2 to ten times bigger than Earth. 

Our solar system, on the other hand, seems less common than some had imagined. We haven’t found anything quite like it. But … it’s still early. And the data we’ve gathered so far has many scientists feeling confident that somewhere out there, just waiting for our telescopes to swing in the right direction, is a planet like Earth.

US President Franklin D. Roosevelt passed Executive Order 9066 in February 1942 — two months after Japan’s bombing of the US Navy base at Pearl Harbor. It empowered the US army to designate strategic “military areas” from which any and all people deemed a threat could be forcibly removed. This began a process of placing 120,000 Japanese Americans in concentration camps during World War II. 

To control the narrative around the removal, the government created a new department, the War Relocation Authority, and hired photographers to document the process. One of those photographers was Dorothea Lange, who had become famous during the 1930s for her Great Depression photographs for the Farm Security Administration. 

Her images featured Japanese-American people in the weeks, days, and hours leading up to their incarceration in the camps, and captured expressions of dignity, resolve, and fear. 

Most of Lange’s candid photos of the removal process weren’t approved for publication by the War Relocation Authority and were “impounded” for the duration of the war. They weren’t seen again widely until 1972, when her former assistant pulled them from the National Archives for a museum exhibit about the incarceration of Japanese Americans, called Executive Order 9066. 

The photos became part of a redress movement for Japanese Americans in the 1970s and 1980s, which ultimately resulted in the Civil Liberties Act of 1988, a bill that approved reparations for survivors of the camps. 

Darkroom is a history and photography series that anchors each episode around a single image. Analyzing what the photo shows (or doesn't show) provides context that helps unravel a wider story. Watch previous episodes here: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLJ8cMiYb3G5ce8J4P5j5qOEtYR94Z3DQs

If there were a floor covering Olympics, marble would probably get gold. Hardwood would get silver. Bronze would maybe go to tile — and linoleum wouldn’t even make the trials. Arguably the most maligned flooring there is, these days linoleum is considered (at best) something you rip out to get to the real floor. But it wasn’t always that way.

Linoleum burst on the scene in the late 19th century, the brainchild of an eccentric inventor named Frederick Walton. Before long it was an international sensation and considered the height of luxury. It was even featured on the Titanic and in British Parliament. For nearly a century, linoleum remained the flooring of choice in homes, shops, and schools all over the world.

But when linoleum fell, it fell hard. For decades it was relegated to schools, hospitals, and your grandma’s kitchen — until recently. These days, linoleum is enjoying an unexpected revival in some of the world’s coolest spaces. Watch the video above to find out why.

For this third episode of our video series with Vox’s Future Perfect team, we went to North Carolina, a state that for decades has been a battleground over the public health impact of hog farming.

Watch Episode 2, The chicken industry's worker safety problem: https://youtu.be/Ia3abCiYX3w

​​Animal Charity Evaluators provided funding without editorial input for the production of this series. 

I interviewed two people in North Carolina who do not appear in the video: Sherri White-Williamson, who heads the Environmental Justice Community Action Network, or EJCAN, a nonprofit working toward water testing in the area, particularly of private wells. 

https://ejcan.org/

I also interviewed Jeff Currie, a member of the Lumbee tribe in North Carolina, and a Waterkeeper Alliance worker whose job it is to test the Lumber River watershed for contamination. The Lumbee tribe is primarily located in Robeson County, one of the areas with a high concentration of hog farms that we cover in the video. 

https://waterkeeper.org/news/who-is-waterkeeper-jefferson-currie-ii-lumber-riverkeeper/

Another feature of North Carolina that makes it more vulnerable to water contamination is its permeable, sandy soil in areas with a high concentration of hog farms. Experts told me this area used to be swampland, and was drained to make way for agriculture. My colleague Liz Scheltens mentions a similar historical context in a video she made about Lake Erie and cow waste pollution: 

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WwhcrpJTzGQ

The location of hog farms in North Carolina is related to the history of tobacco farming in the state. When the public health effects of smoking became clear, the government stopped supporting it. Many North Carolina farmers started to diversify their practices, including raising hogs. That’s exactly how Tom Butler got into raising pigs — he was once a tobacco farmer: 

http://archive.pov.org/brightleaves/historical-background/

Advocates and community members are also deeply concerned about the proliferation of large-scale poultry facilities in North Carolina, which accelerated when the moratorium on new or expanded hog farms was enacted in 1997: 

https://www.wunc.org/environment/2020-07-30/explosive-growth-in-nc-poultry-farms-poses-grave-risks-new-report-says

The Align RNG map we show in this video, illustrating where a proposed methane pipeline might go, has been a source of heated debate in North Carolina. The Southern Environmental Law Center and other organizations have asked the state for more transparency about where the farms and the pipeline are located in order to get informed public input on the project. More details on this are in this story: 

https://ncpolicywatch.com/2020/11/16/smithfield-dominion-propose-major-swine-gas-project-but-details-are-secret-troubling-residents/

We contacted Align RNG and Smithfield for this story, and they both said they sought public input for the biogas project and touted the project’s potential for cutting greenhouse gas emissions. They also said that the state of North Carolina has “stringent” permit regulations that they adhere to. 

Vox’s Future Perfect team covered this issue here:

After 25 years and nearly $10 billion, the James Webb Space Telescope has finally left planet Earth. Billed as a successor to the beloved Hubble Space Telescope, the Webb’s mirror is six times larger and its instruments are tuned to observe longer wavelengths, in order to detect the stretched-out light from primitive galaxies 13.5 billion light years away.

That primary mission — to see the first stars and galaxies that formed after the Big Bang — determined the unusual and challenging design of the telescope. Instead of a shiny tube, the Webb Telescope looks like a giant honeycomb riding on a silver surfboard. The short answer to why it looks like that is: It needs to be very big and very cold.

In the video above, NASA astrophysicist Amber Straughn and Vox's Joss Fong build a small model of the telescope to explore its extraordinary design.

The flu vaccine is something many of us take for granted. Every year, starting in the early fall, “free flu shot available” signs start to line pharmacies and clinics –  and yet in the US, only around half the population actually gets the vaccine. When talking about the flu, many equate it to a terrible cold, inconvenient at worst. But annual strains of influenza are estimated to cause hundreds of thousands of deaths worldwide. The reality is, we’ve been living with influenza for so long that we often forget just how dangerous it can be.

The reason we need an annual vaccine for the flu is that it’s particularly prone to changing. That ability to mutate is also what makes it particularly good at causing pandemic-level threats. The last four global pandemics before Covid-19 were caused by an influenza virus. Experts warn that another one is inevitable and that our seasonal flu vaccine isn’t going to stop it.

For 80 years, the way we research and make our annual flu vaccine has remained the same. It’s a costly and timely process that involves predictions and chicken eggs. The result is a seasonal flu vaccine that’s certainly good enough, but we can do better. And now researchers are closer than ever to something new - something like a flu vaccine that remains effective year after year, regardless of the strain. Something that could stop an outbreak before it starts; something like a universal flu vaccine.

Covid-19 looked like it could have been the end of movie theaters. Theaters couldn’t show movies. Some of the biggest American theater chains were on the brink of bankruptcy. And US movie studios started trying something new: releasing big movies digitally and in theaters at the same time.

The ""theatrical window,"" when a movie plays only in theaters, typically has a minimum length set by deals between movie studios and movie theaters. You might remember a time when the theatrical window was long, and you had to wait close to a year before a movie would come out on video or DVD. But over the years, as options for home viewing have proliferated, that window has shrunk. By 2019, many movies were becoming available at home less than 3 months after their original release.

Behind that shrinking window were decades-long negotiations between theaters and studios over how long that window should be — and it seemed like movie studios had gradually gotten the upper hand. But the pandemic gave the studios leverage like never before. Now they could bypass movie theaters altogether.

But in the end, they chose not to. Big movies still come out in theaters first. The theatrical window still exists. Why?

When many countries began to recommend boosters not just for the older and high-risk, but for all adults, they were essentially taking sides in a still-unresolved debate around that question: Why give an extra dose to healthy adults who are still very protected against severe Covid-19 cases from their original dose?

But since the omicron variant has emerged, many have changed their minds. To understand why, we talked to one formerly skeptical expert who scheduled her own booster shot based on what she learned about omicron. We spoke to her about what happens in your immune system when you get that third (or second) shot, and why it could be especially useful in stopping the spread of omicron.

Since our conversation with Dr. Gounder, newer data seems to corroborate the prediction that boosters will be effective against omicron: https://www.nytimes.com/live/2021/12/08/world/omicron-variant-covid

A crisis has been escalating along the border that divides Belarus and the European Union. For several weeks, thousands of migrants looking to reach the EU were trapped between Poland and Belarus, living in freezing camps with no humanitarian aid. Today, the migrants have been moved to warehouses for shelter, but this crisis isn’t over.

Since 2015, Europe has experienced several migration waves, but this one was different: This one was manufactured. Belarus lured migrants to the border to pressure the EU to lift sanctions. And while this particular crisis has started to die down, the problem isn’t going away. It’s the result of a complex EU migration policy that has opened the door to the exploitation of migrants, and until that policy is fixed, Belarus or other bordering nations could create a crisis all over again. 

To understand how Belarus manufactured this crisis and the geopolitical context that allowed it to happen, watch the video above.

The pope is one of the most recognizable figures in the world, in large part because of the clothes he wears: all white, ornate ponchos, various hats. But all popes don’t actually dress alike. There are different articles of clothing that correspond to different events and times of year, and there is a certain amount of personal choice involved. 

Pope Francis has made waves across the Catholic Church with his relatively progressive, modern takes on church doctrine and tradition, and his clothing is a visual shorthand for those policies.

Towards the end of every year the countdown until the United States government goes into a shutdown begins. Congress and the President usually avoid it in the last hour, but sometimes they don’t manage to agree on a spending bill and the government actually shuts down. The US is really the only country that does this.

The longest one in history, in 2019, lasted 35 days. Federal workers — and many contractors — didn’t get a paycheck for 35 days. Some of those employees were furloughed, meaning they didn’t have to go into work, but more than half of them still had to go into the office unpaid. 

So… why? It goes back to the Constitution and how the federal government funds its agencies. We talk to a law professor and workers who have been through a shutdown to explain.

In the ’80s, scientists discovered there was a hole in the ozone over the South Pole. A significant layer of gas that deflects much of the sun’s radiation was disappearing much faster than anyone expected. Projections suggested it would collapse by 2050, increasing skin cancer rates, harming crops, and destroying the marine food chain. The situation was dire. But today, we are on the path to recovery.

Dr. Susan Solomon, among other scientists, contributed key findings to understand what was depleting the ozone layer and how to address it. In this video she takes us back to her expedition to Antarctica, breaks down how we managed to fix this huge problem, and looks at our next big environmental challenge — climate change — with the unbridled optimism that drove her to fix the ozone hole.

They don’t necessarily think about a part of our society that is vital to our food, our water, our climate and our future,” says David Haight, the VP of Programs at American Farmland Trust (AFT). But those farmers are taking on modern problems. Facing issues like land loss, extreme weather, and economic disruption, individual farms are feeling the heat. “I worry that we’re at a tipping point with agriculture,” says Dayna Burtness of Nettle Valley Farm, an independent farmer who raises her pigs on pasture.

One of London’s most unusual luxury trends might be its gigantic basements.

Professor Roger Burrows and his coauthors collected data on every basement construction project in from 2008 to 2019, and mapped it. They found more than 7,000 basement additions had been built. A combination of historic preservation laws, rapidly ballooning property values, and changing tastes have led to a boom in basement building.

This construction hasn’t been without complications. Many of the existing residents see the constant construction as a “plague” that’s hollowed out the city, contributed to air pollution, and even changed the acoustics of their homes. Burrows sees it as a symbol of increasing wealth inequality in the global city.

Correction: Typo 1:25, Roger Burrows is Professor of cities at Newcastle University.

Subscribe and turn on notifications 🔔 so you don't miss any videos: http://goo.gl/0bsAjO

The Dutch angle (also called the Dutch tilt, canted angle, or oblique angle) is a filmmaking technique that involves setting the camera at an angle and tilting the entire scene. You’ll see it everywhere from blockbuster movies to soap commercials. It’s used to emphasize when something is a little off, or just to make a shot look more interesting. 

The thing is… it’s not actually Dutch. And it didn’t start with filmmakers. It was pioneered by German directors during World War I, when outside films were blocked from being shown in Germany. Unlike Hollywood, which was serving up largely glamorous, rollicking films, the German film industry took inspiration from the Expressionist movement in art and literature, which was focused on processing the insanity of world war. Its themes touched on betrayal, suicide, psychosis, and terror. And Expressionist films expressed that darkness not just through their plotlines, but their set designs, costumes… and unusual camera shots.

The roots of the Taliban movement go back to 1979, when the Soviet Union invaded Afghanistan. They were there to prop up a communist Afghan government that was supported by a minority of urban residents. But the vast majority of Afghans lived in rural areas. Here, authority came from tribal and ethnic groups, and life revolved around conservative practices of Islam. 

Rural Afghans formed militias called mujahideen and drove out the Soviets. But then they fell into a civil war with each other. Out of this chaos emerged a group of Islamic teachers and students called the Taliban. They swept through the country, destroying mujahideen groups and imposing a strict order. In 1996, they took the capital city of Kabul. The Taliban ruled Afghanistan until 2001, when the US invaded. 

In a sense, the cycle of invasion and rebellion began again. Urban areas were reformed while rural areas suffered, allowing the Taliban to resurge. In 2021, the Taliban took back Kabul and the country.

Subscribe to our channel! http://goo.gl/0bsAjO

In the 1960s, the US began a love affair with chicken, and poultry workers paid the cost. Over the past few decades, poultry processing line speeds have increased to meet demand. But that’s happened in tandem with the decline of unions and deregulation of the industry. The result is a high rate of workplace injuries and repetitive motion disorders, with gaps in workplace safety oversight. 

For this video, we contacted Tyson Foods Inc. and the National Chicken Council for comment. The NCC, the poultry industry lobby that has repeatedly requested increases in line speeds, wrote that faster line speeds do not affect the pace of work because plants will add additional staff and lines to accommodate speed increases. Through our reporting, we weren’t able to substantiate this claim, and the NCC did not respond when we asked for an example or for any evidence that this is the industry standard. 

The NCC also mentioned that other countries run poultry line speeds as fast as, if not faster than, the US. It’s difficult to do an apples-to-apples comparison with other countries. Claire Kelloway, reporter and researcher for OpenMarkets, noted that in Europe, for example, factories are typically smaller than US plants, and have higher rates of unionization and more industry safety regulation. The regulating agencies enforce longer breaks and switching up job roles to avoid repetition. Even so, working conditions in poultry plants are still criticized there. 

While the NCC cited a decline in workplace injuries, advocates and experts say that this data is unreliable. It relies on workers reporting injuries to the government agency that regulates workplace safety, OSHA. There are a number of reasons a poultry worker might not report an injury or illness, including language barriers or fears over their citizenship status. Worker and advocate-led surveys show high levels of injury, here are examples: 

https://www.splcenter.org/sites/default/files/d6_legacy_files/downloads/publication/Unsafe_at_These_Speeds_web.pdf

https://foodchainworkers.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/Hands-That-Feed-Us-Report.pdf

https://www.uusc.org/sites/default/files/wages_and_working_conditions_in_arkansas_poultry_plants.pdf

Tyson disputes, without evidence, the petition that Magaly Licolli presented on behalf of the workers at the Berry Street poultry plant in Springdale, Arkansas. The company said it was misrepresented to those who signed it and that there were duplicate signatures. Tyson also noted that it offered raises to poultry workers in 2021 amid a labor shortage. 

We also contacted OSHA for comment. They noted that they issue citations or fines to any workplace found by federal inspectors to have violated their safety standards, but confirmed that it is under the jurisdiction of the USDA to determine line speeds. They also said that they do not track data on the use of the chemicals we mention in the video: chlorine, ammonia, and peracetic acid.

Horror films — and specifically slashers — are known for abundant on-screen violence. Making that fake violence look real often comes down to props. Prop masters and special effects workers prepare knives, blood, and explosions to slash people...without actually slashing them. 

To pull this off they might use rubber, plastic, retractable, or even digital knives. Blood recipes have been improving over the decades to flow more realistically, and better soak into clothing. And explosions, both with air and squibs, push out blood to make scenes feel more realistic.

With movies, it’s often what you don’t see that makes the difference. After prop masters, makeup artists, and special effects artists complete their work, they pass the baton off to other members of the crew. Actors sell it, camera operators get the right angles to highlight the action while hiding the tubes and wires, and editors cut the different takes together. When pulled off well, it’ll make you feel like what you're witnessing is real — even though it’s just movie magic.

Nearly every year, America seems to teeter on the edge of a crisis as the national debt comes dangerously close to hitting the “debt ceiling” and the President and Congress fight over raising it. The “debt ceiling” is really just a limit on how much debt the country can take on. While the US isn’t the only country to have one, it is the only country to have legislation that regularly puts it on the brink of economic disaster.

The current US debt is nearing $29 trillion. That's a trillion with a T. Is that… too much? And who does it affect? 

Want to know what the US national debt is as of right now? Here’s where the Treasury has it updated: https://fiscaldata.treasury.gov/datasets/debt-to-the-penny/debt-to-the-penny

If you’ve seen new construction around your city, you’ve probably seen these distinctive rectangular panels. Sometimes plain, sometimes multi-colored, they’re absolutely everywhere. The video above explains how they conceal an entire system that helps protect buildings.

Over the 20th century, building technology has changed to allow the exterior of a building to be separate from the structure holding it up. That’s present in rainscreen cladding — the enclosure system that ends up being used in so many of those distinctive panels. By creating a small air gap between the exterior wall and the structure, it gives water an opportunity to dry — saving our modern buildings from any rot and decay.

Watch the video above to learn more about how architects and building scientists use rainscreen cladding to explore aesthetic possibilities while protecting their buildings.

If you’ve seen any remotely creepy movie, you’ve heard a loon wail: that mournful, nearly human ooo-ooo-oooo. It pops up whenever a movie needs to convey melancholy or trepidation, often accompanied by a full moon or some fog. But for the most part, loons have no business being in the background of those scenes. 

With the help of some internet birders, we took a deep dive (pun intended) into the world of loons to explain how Hollywood misuses this bird call — and why the wail is so haunting in the first place. 

To learn more about loons and what you can do to help protect them check out the Loon Preservation Committee (https://loon.org/) and the  Adirondack Center for Loon Conservation (https://www.adkloon.org/).

The NBA introduced the 3-point line in 1979, and not much changed right away. Players weren’t used to shooting from far out, so for the first few years, they mostly didn’t. It wasn’t until the 1986-1987 season that the league as a whole scored over 100 3s in one season.

The arc of the line was shortened for a few years in the '90s, but besides that, it hasn't changed much — and that’s given players and coaches an opportunity to strategize around it. In 2014, statistic-obsessed sports executive Daryl Morey led what many people call the 3-point revolution. He used the D-League Rio Grande Valley Vipers as a testing ground to see if volume shooting from the 3-point line netted better results than shooting 2s — and it worked. 

The math states that scoring one-third of your shots from behind the 3-point line is as good as scoring half your shots from inside the line. In other words: Shooting as many 3s as possible will likely lead to a higher score.

The league took notice, and teams and players followed suit. 3s have become so prevalent in recent years that fans are criticizing the league for being oversaturated with them. Critics worry that the game is on the verge of becoming boring because everyone is trying to do the same thing. And that's led some to wonder if the NBA should move the 3-point line back.

James Brouwer has been collecting postcards for more than 30 years. His collection numbers over 11,000; images of old age homes, ugly restaurants, and 1960s advertising are neatly organized in boxes in his Canadian home. But James started to notice that some of his postcards — dozens, in fact — appeared to have the exact same sky. Looking even closer, he noticed that the same-sky postcards were all made by one publisher: Dexter Press out of West Nyack, New York. 

Dexter Press was once one of the largest publishers of ""chrome-era postcards,"" — postcards made from color photographs that became popular in the 1940s. By the time James started collecting in the 1980s, ""chrome cards"" were mostly overlooked by collectors, and could be bought for cheap in flea markets. It wasn't until he looked through a lot of these cards that he noticed the same sky repeating itself. 

Darkroom producer Coleman Lowndes took a trip to British Columbia, Canada, to see James's collection for himself — and to help solve the mystery of these identical skies. To James though, the mystery doesn't really matter. The reason the skies look the same is less important to him than the unusual visual effect it produces when all these skies come together.

Darkroom is a history and photography series that anchors each episode around a single image. Analyzing what the photo shows (or doesn't show) provides context that helps unravel a wider story. Watch previous episodes here: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLJ8cMiYb3G5ce8J4P5j5qOEtYR94Z3DQs

The infamous Indian Point nuclear plant, located roughly 30 miles north of Manhattan, shut down earlier this year. To some, the shutdown was a victory following decades of protests about safety and environmental concerns. Here’s the problem: When operating, Indian Point provided more electricity than is produced annually by all solar and wind in New York state. And Indian Point is not the only plant closing. Cleo Abram explores why so many nuclear plants are shutting down - by taking a closer look at Indian Point.

Cattle auctions happen every day throughout the US; they serve a crucial purpose for the cattle markets. Inside one of these auctions, like the one we profile in St. Onge, South Dakota, you can see how a competitive market functions. There are multiple producers and buyers competing for a commodity, which results in a value, or price, for that commodity. 

But over the past 40 years, the meatpacking sector — made up of the companies that buy and slaughter cattle for consumption — has undergone a dramatic degree of corporate consolidation. In the 1980s, the US relaxed its approach to antitrust enforcement, one tool the government uses to rein in market concentration. Today, only four companies process 85 percent of all the cattle produced in the US. 

Cattle ranchers say this is affecting their ability to compete for good prices and make a living. This is one way industrialized agriculture is making it difficult for independent farmers and ranchers to stay in business in America. 

For this story, we contacted Tyson Foods, Cargill, National Beef, and JBS for comment. We only received a response from Tyson: A representative shared testimony from one of the company’s executives at a recent Senate hearing. We included that in this video, and the full transcript is below:

PIulbHyK0bc,Vox,UCLXo7UDZvByw2ixzpQCufnA,Why heaters are the future of cooling,2021-09-24 12:00:12+00:00,"A huge number of people still heat their homes with fossil fuels. There’s a better way.

Subscribe to our channel! http://goo.gl/0bsAjO

Experts call it the “cold crunch."" As temperatures rise in regions that historically haven’t needed indoor cooling, global demand for air conditioning units is expected to skyrocket. Indoor cooling is already the fastest-growing use of energy in buildings. But the emissions associated with cooling buildings are still tiny compared to the emissions from heating them — and that's because while air conditioning uses electricity, our heat is still largely generated by burning fossil fuels.

The way we heat our homes and buildings is one of the biggest contributors to climate change. But a solution may actually come from the rush of consumers looking to buy AC for the first time. They're a huge potential market for a different kind of system — the electric heat pump. A heat pump works like a two-way air conditioner, using electricity and a chemical refrigerant to transfer heat either into or out of a building. Instead of using fossil fuels to generate heat, it uses electricity to transfer heat, and it does it efficiently. And if heat pumps are widely adopted, they could make a major impact on the carbon emissions generated by buildings.

1910’s “Big Blow Up” remains one of the most disastrous wildfires in US history. Hurricane-force winds fanned and threw embers for miles. Full, flaming trees became dangerous projectiles as they were reportedly torn from the ground. After two days, 3 million acres throughout Idaho and Montana had burned. The devastation had a lasting effect on the United States and shaped US forest policy for the next century. But it also created a deep misunderstanding of what fire means to a forest.

A century of fire suppression has reshaped our forests. The floor is littered with material that is dense, dried, and dead. Now, climate change is highlighting why that’s a problem. Increasingly hot, dry weather has resulted in a longer, more dramatic wildfire season, and the forests are ready to ignite. The United States is struggling to keep up with the blazes year after year, so scientists and indigenous people are pushing to bring back a centuries-old practice: burning the forests on our own terms, through prescribed burning. 

This is the third video in our climate change coverage this week and the next. You can watch the first video on extreme heat 🌡 and what cities are doing to cool down here: https://youtu.be/ZQ6fSHr5TJg

In the near future, the energy made in the US is going to be much greener. The country’s current goal is for solar plants alone to make nearly half of US electricity by 2050. But we can’t just build solar plants where coal and gas plants used to be. They have to be built where it's… sunny. And wind turbines have to be built where it’s windy. The problem is, that’s not always where the people who need the power are.

The distance from energy source to energy need is about to get a lot bigger. And the US is going to need more high-voltage transmission lines. A lot more. As soon as possible. While solar plants can be built relatively fast, high-voltage transmission projects can take up to 10 years. So experts say we need to start proactively building them, right now.

It’s time to stop looking at trees as a form of “beautification.” They are, instead, a living form of infrastructure, providing a variety of services that include stormwater management, air filtering, carbon sequestration, and, most importantly for a city like Phoenix, Arizona, they cool the environment around them. 

Trees can lower neighborhood temperatures in three ways: 
1) Their shade prevents solar radiation from hitting paved surfaces like concrete and asphalt, which absorb energy and rerelease it into the air as heat. 
2) Their leaves pull heat from the immediate area in order to evapotranspirate water that’s drawn from the soil. 
And, 3) If you’re standing under one, a tree protects your body directly from the sun’s rays. If you’ve ever made a summer visit to a dry, hot city like Phoenix, you’ll know how important shade is for making any outdoor experiences tolerable. 

As Phoenix deals with a rising frequency of extreme heat waves — which aren’t only deadly, but also cause worrisome spikes in energy demand — the city is looking to trees as part of its heat mitigation strategy. Phoenix isn’t devoid of trees, but they’re distributed unevenly across the city. A quick glance at a satellite image of the metro area reveals substantial green splotches in the north and east and brown ones in the south and west, where many lower-income neighborhoods are located. 

So Phoenix recently pledged to reach “tree equity” by 2030, under an agreement with American Forests, a national tree organization. I visited Phoenix recently to take a look at the current state of the city’s urban forest. In this video, we use drone imagery and thermal cameras to understand how the urban design of the city contributes to extreme heat, and what it can do to cool down.

The Anishinaabe or Ojibwe, have lived on the land we now call Minnesota since long before European settlers arrived. For as long as they can remember, their lives have been intertwined with that of the moose. It’s more than a source of food — it’s also a way of staying in touch with their ancestors, who carved game pieces from the antlers, fashioned elaborate clothing from the hides, and used the hair to embroider intricate designs on everything from stockings to cradleboards. 

But this relationship between the Anishinaabe and the moose is in danger. The population has been in freefall for the past two decades. We joined a group of scientists as they set out to unravel the mystery, in the hopes that this generation of Anishinaabe won’t be the last to thrive alongside the moose.

In this video, Vox’s Phil Edwards interviews Galen Davis of Quixel at Epic Games. His job is as a developer, but sometimes he goes out into the desert to scan rocks.

This scanning economy is a crucial new stage in making realistic 3D games today. Rather than modeling and texturing assets manually, designers often rely on scanned assets to make their games, movies, or other 3d productions look real. Quixel sent Davis to Moab, Utah, just to scan the exotic terrain there for use in Unreal Engine.

There are other ways to get assets for 3D productions, from your phone to the many different available marketplaces. These provide opportunities for photoreal assets to be downloaded instead of created, allowing designers to save time and improve the quality of their work.

Doors are so common in the real world that you probably don’t stop to think about how to operate them. 

But for video game designers, that’s not the case. For a video game door to feel real, it takes a ton of challenging work. Video game doors have to interact seamlessly with their surroundings, make logical sense, and look good too. They have to strike a delicate balance between real-world accuracy and playability.

All these factors mean designing a door usually requires work from every department at a game company.

Different types of doors require different amounts of work. And these same challenges crop up as you try to add almost any element to a game.

Like any great piece of art, the blood, sweat, and tears that go into doors are often invisible. The best doors are the ones that work seamlessly, and go unnoticed. In this video, we talk to Bryan Singh, a game developer, about why doors are so tricky.

Lee Harvey Oswald was murdered two days after he was arrested for assassinating US President John F. Kennedy. But before Oswald died, he claimed that a damning piece of evidence against him — a photo showing Oswald holding the rifle that killed the president — was fake. In fact, he said his face was superimposed onto another person’s body to set him up. 

The photo’s authenticity has been in question ever since, and it plays a key role in the conspiracy theory surrounding JFK’s death. The shadows in the photo seem inconsistent, and Oswald’s crooked stance under the weight of the rifle looks like he is about to tip over. Plus, his face doesn’t look the same as it does in his mug shot. 

For decades, conspiracy theorists have used this image as key evidence to suggest that Oswald was framed. But decades of analysis — including recent 3D forensic analysis — has proved over and over that the photo is likely authentic. 

Darkroom is a history and photography series that anchors each episode around a single image. Analyzing what the photo shows (or doesn't show) provides context that helps unravel a wider story. Watch previous episodes here: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLJ8cMiYb3G5ce8J4P5j5qOEtYR94Z3DQs

In the last century, 85% of the world’s oyster reefs have vanished. And we’re only recently beginning to understand what that’s cost us: While they don’t look incredibly appealing from the shore, oysters are vital to bays and waterways around the world. A single oyster can filter up to 50 gallons of water every day. And over time, oysters form incredible reef structures that double as habitats for various species of fish, crabs, and other animals. In their absence, our coastlines have suffered.

Now, several projects from New York to the Gulf of Mexico and Bangladesh are aiming to bring the oysters back. Because not only are oysters vital ecosystems; they can also protect us from the rising oceans by acting as breakwaters, deflecting waves before they hit the shore. It won’t stop the seas from rising - but embracing living shorelines could help protect us from what’s to come.

On August 15, 2021, the Taliban took over Afghanistan’s capital, Kabul. The Afghan president fled the country. Almost all of Afghanistan is now under Taliban control. It marks the end of an era: America’s longest war is now over, and it lost. And it happened fast, stunning the world and leaving many in the country racing to find an exit.

But even among those surprised by the way the end played out, many knew the war was destined to end badly. According to some experts, the seeds of disaster were planted back at the war’s very beginning.

Ever since the American war in Afghanistan began in the aftermath of the 9/11 attacks, the US government has struggled with answering exactly why the military was there. In the very beginning the goal was relatively clear: to capture the perpetrator of the attacks, Osama bin Laden. But almost immediately, the goals became murkier, and more complicated.

In this video, investigative reporter Azmat Khan and former US ambassador to Afghanistan Michael McKinley explain what the US military was actually doing in Afghanistan, what it got wrong, and why America’s long intervention there is considered a failure. 

Some of the sources we used in our reporting: 

This report from Brown University’s Cost of War project has good data on how many Afghan civilians have beem killed in airstrikes:

The comparison of American attitudes towards the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq are from Gallup polls:
https://news.gallup.com/poll/1633/iraq.aspx
https://news.gallup.com/poll/167471/americans-view-afghanistan-war-mistake.aspx

Over the past year, housing prices in the US rose precipitously. Low interest rates and millennials’ entry into the market spiked demand across the nation, leading housing prices in some cities to increase by more than 20 percent in one year, and crushing the dreams of many would-be homeowners. 

But housing prices in the US were a problem long before 2020 — and while demand is a big part of the story, there’s an even bigger reason it’s increasingly difficult for Americans to find affordable housing: We don’t have enough houses. According to one estimate, the US is now facing a nearly four-million-home shortage. And the primary reason for that shortage is what’s called exclusionary zoning.

Zoning laws are the local rules and regulations that decide what types of homes can be built where. These rules can sometimes have good intentions. But they also have a dark history in the United States as a tool to keep certain races, religions, and nationalities out of white neighborhoods. And while zoning laws in the US are no longer explicitly racist, their effect remains basically the same: to keep affordable housing, and the people who need it, away from the wealthiest Americans.

Today, in the majority of the US, especially in cities with good jobs, it’s illegal to build many affordable types of housing. And it’s led to a widespread affordability crisis. Watch the video above for more.

Subscribe to our channel! http://goo.gl/0bsAjO

Animals all across the world are undergoing a strange transformation. In Appalachia, salamander body sizes have decreased by 8 percent since 1960; menhaden fish caught in the Atlantic are 15 percent lighter than they were in 1987; and bird specimens at Chicago’s Field Museum have lost up to 4 percent of their body mass since collection began in the late 1970s. 

A growing body of evidence suggests that these changes are the product of global warming: as average temperatures rise, smaller bodies make it easier for warm-blooded animals to stay cool. For cold-blooded animals, warming temperatures speed up metabolism and stunt their full growth. These changes might appear relatively small, but they can have a huge impact on animal’s lives, making them more susceptible to predation, reduced offspring count, and drying out in droughts. 

Wild animals already face a wide range of threats; shrinking could push them even closer to extinction — with dire consequences for the ecosystems that humans rely on.

Subscribe to our channel! http://goo.gl/0bsAjO

Immigration looked very different before 1996, when President Bill Clinton signed the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act (IIRIRA). The law was supposed to stop undocumented immigration by increasing enforcement and punishing people for being in the US undocumented. Instead, it incentivized people to stay in the US — and the undocumented population doubled.  

When researching this story we used a lot of great resources. Here are a few of the most helpful:

This collection of articles on IIRIRA by the Center for Migration Studies explains many angles on the law itself, the politics of the time that led to its passing, and the ongoing impact: https://cmsny.org/publications/jmhs-sc-iirira/

Douglas S. Massey at Princeton and his co-authors have written about how border enforcement backfired, including in this 2016 paper: https://spia.princeton.edu/system/files/research/documents/684200.pdf

Elegant Olympic dives fly by in a matter of seconds. Because of that, it’s hard to know what to look for when you try to judge the sport from your couch. One thing that’s easy to see, though? The splash.

If you’ve watched any Olympics diving coverage, you may have noticed that the splashes athletes make are tiny. Divers spend years training to perform with minimal splash, in the same way that gymnasts train to stick their landings.

In this video, Team USA’s head diving coach Drew Johansen explains the three major components he uses to guide his athletes towards smaller splashes: the above water position, the underwater swim, and the underwater pike. 

And while the sport of diving isn’t all about getting splashes, a small splash is the perfect punctuation to a job well done.

Subscribe to our channel! http://goo.gl/0bsAjO

Every Summer Olympics, gymnasts amaze viewers by performing incredibly complex and dangerous skills. As these routines get more and more complicated, they become harder to top -- and the latest way to add value and distinguish a routine is the wolf turn.

The wolf turn has actually been around for decades. But recently it’s become a favorite in balance beam and floor routines. A gymnast will get into a squat position with one leg stretched out. She’ll then stretch out her arms and wind them up. Once she finds her balance, she’ll start spinning. Finally, she’ll stop and return to her original stance. 

Seems pretty simple, but the movement relies on a delicate balance of mass and inertia. One wobble and things fall apart. Of course, there’s a reason gymnasts perform this delicate balance: points. The turn is used strategically because its relatively high difficulty level means judges value it more than a regular turn.

To read more about how judges score gymnasts, check out this article from USA gymnastics: https://usagym.org/pages/events/pages/fig_scoring.html and this one from The Balance Beam Situation: https://balancebeamsituation.com/elite-skill-database/wolf-turn-double-balance-beam/

Subscribe and turn on notifications (🔔) so you don't miss any videos: http://goo.gl/0bsAjO

In 1894, a notorious poacher, Ed Howell, was caught in Yellowstone National Park slaughtering bison, which were on the brink of extinction. US Army soldiers patrolling the park brought him into custody, and the story led to the first US federal law protecting wildlife. The soldiers were thought of as heroes for stopping the killer. But it was the US Army who had been responsible for driving bison to near-extinction in the first place. 

In the mid-1800s, a cultural belief known as “manifest destiny” dictated that white settlers were the rightful owners of the entire North American continent – even though Native Americans had inhabited the land for centuries. In order to clear that land for white settlers, the US Army engaged in violent scorched-earth tactics against the Indigenous peoples of the Great Plains. One big part of that campaign was to eliminate their crucial food source: the bison. 

By the end of the 1800s, a combination of commercial and recreational hunting, plus the actions of the US Army, had depleted the bison population to under a thousand, down from tens of millions at the beginning of the century. Around the same time, the US government set aside some of the land once inhabited by the Plains Indians as a national park, and in 1872 Yellowstone was established. 

A key mission of Yellowstone was to conserve the land and the animals that roamed there, including the bison. Today, the soldiers that once patrolled the park are celebrated for having “saved” the bison in Yellowstone, obscuring their own violent contribution to the animal’s near-extinction.

Subscribe to our channel! http://goo.gl/0bsAjO

There are few single events that demand as much skill as the 400-meter hurdle race. Olympians need to have the speed of a 200-meter dash runner, the endurance of an 800-meter runner, an understanding of rhythm, and, of course, the ability to efficiently clear a hurdle. 

Various techniques can make or break a race. If you jump too high, you’re wasting time and energy; too low and you collide with a hurdle. Even if your technique over the hurdles is perfect, you can’t win if you don’t have the speed. Former Olympic hurdler and (until very recently) world record-holder Kevin Young helps us break down the rhythm of the 400-meter hurdles.

Correction: Karsten Warholm broke Kevin Young's record at a Diamond League meet in Oslo, Norway on July 1 — not at the Olympic Trials.

The richest in America don't make money like most Americans. Most people pay income taxes from a regular job. But many in the top 1% make money off their investments, like stocks, and pay capital gains taxes. While normal income has a maximum tax rate of 37%, long-term capital gains tops out at just 20%. Changing that rate, and some loopholes that benefit the wealthiest, is seen as one way to tax the rich.

In December 2019, Taiwan‘s government learned that at least seven atypical pneumonia cases had been reported in Wuhan, China. Because of Taiwan’s proximity to China and the number of flights back and forth, it was expected to have the second-highest number of Covid-19 cases worldwide. 

Instead, Taiwan has had one of the lowest Covid-19 death rates in the world. Thanks in part to a sophisticated digitized health care system and a mandatory two-week quarantine for all travelers, life in Taiwan went on with relative normalcy. But then, in May 2021, a new wave of cases complicated the country’s success. 

So how did Taiwan, the ninth-most densely populated nation in the world, avoid a more severe spread of a highly contagious virus for so long? And what lessons can be learned from their response to the outbreak?

fVKjzvDVGPs,Vox,UCLXo7UDZvByw2ixzpQCufnA,How sperm got all the credit in the fertilization story,2021-07-02 16:15:01+00:00,"The school system probably failed you. Here’s how fertilization really happens.

Subscribe to our channel! http://goo.gl/0bsAjO

The fertilization story most of us know is skewed. In the textbooks we read in middle school and high school, it’s presented like a sort of fairytale: The strong sperm go on a journey where they have to defeat and overcome obstacles to reach the egg. Meanwhile, the egg just sits around waiting to be fertilized. 

The story inherently carries a lot of gender bias, and what’s worse is that it’s not entirely true. The sperm can’t make the journey on its own, and the real story of fertilization involves two reproductive systems working together. While sperm have tails that seem like they’re meant for swimming, they can’t propel themselves all the way to the egg — they need the female reproductive tract to help move them forward. And the egg doesn’t just wait around for the sperm to reach it — it has an active role in selecting which sperm will be the best one to fertilize it. 

So why has the fertilization story been skewed in this gender-biased way? We dig into a study of textbooks from middle school to medical school to find out. 

Read the original studies here:

Subscribe and turn on notifications (🔔) so you don't miss any videos: http://goo.gl/0bsAjO

Life magazine, then the most popular general interest weekly in the United States, announced in 1961 that it wanted to help win the Cold War. Communist revolutionary Fidel Castro had taken control of Cuba two years earlier, making nearby Latin American countries the newest battleground over economic influence between the capitalist US and communist Soviet Union. The magazine wanted to promote President John F. Kennedy’s new “Alliance for Progress” financial aid program, which planned to use financial incentives to encourage Latin American countries to resist communism and fall under US influence. 

As part of its new mission, Life sent photographer Gordon Parks to Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, to report on systemic poverty there. His resulting photo essay, and in particular his main subject, 12-year-old Flavio da Silva, was hugely popular in the US. Life’s readers, moved by the photos of Flavio and his story of struggling with severe asthma, mailed in thousands in donations to “save him.” The leading pediatric asthma hospital in the US, in Denver, Colorado, offered to treat him for free. A follow-up cover story by Life, titled “Flavio’s Rescue,” celebrated American generosity. 

But Brazilian media saw the photo essay as a negative, stereotypical view of Brazil. Brazilian magazine O Cruzeiro — a weekly publication that, like Life, featured photographic essays — decided to respond to Life’s report. O Cruzeiro sent one of its photographers, Henri Ballot, to New York. There, he photographed a family of Puerto Rican immigrants living in a poor area of Manhattan, and O Cruzeiro printed the photos in a layout that directly copied Life’s. When examined side by side, the two photo essays — and the international feud they kicked off — tell a story of sensationalism, and propaganda. 

Ultimately, US intervention in Latin American in the 1960s didn’t work out as Kennedy hoped. The Alliance for Progress sent Latin American countries billions of dollars in financial aid, but it didn’t end up benefiting the people living in the region, and by the 1970s was considered a failure. Like the two photo essays, the initiative was more about propaganda than it was about addressing the root causes of poverty.

Subscribe and turn on notifications (🔔) so you don't miss any videos: http://goo.gl/0bsAjO

Before each serve, most professional tennis players go through a ritual to get in the zone. Novak Djokovic will bounce the ball with his racket, then with his hand. Rafael Nadal will usually pull his shorts and the sleeves around his shoulders, then touch his nose and tuck his hair behind his ears. All very distinct routines. But there’s one tennis ritual nearly every pro tennis player does: choosing a specific tennis ball. A common belief among players is that the ball they choose can help them win.

But there’s real physics at play behind this ritual — and It all comes down to the fuzz. For a faster serve, players try to find a compact ball. For a slower serve, they feel for more fuzz. The idea is that a fluffier ball is more likely to be slowed by drag as it travels through the air — and that choosing the right level of fuzz can help the serving player defeat their opponent.

Like any virus, SARS-CoV-2 has been mutating constantly since the beginning of the pandemic. Until November of 2020, though, that didn’t seem to matter. That’s when scientists in the United Kingdom noticed an alarming change: The virus had mutated in a way that made it more transmissible. Within a month, similar reports were emerging from places around the world. Suddenly, it seemed the virus was changing at an alarming rate.

SARS-CoV-2 hasn’t actually been mutating faster, though. Instead, by letting it spread around the world, we’ve just given it more and more opportunities to mutate as it replicates. The result is that, after countless random mutations, there are signs that the virus is beginning to adapt to our natural defenses. And because it’s completely normal for a virus to change over time, we shouldn’t expect it to stop. The only real way to stop those changes is to stop giving the virus so many opportunities.

In April 2021, India began registering some of the highest numbers of Covid-19 cases in the world. When that happened, the demand for life-saving oxygen soared too. But India wasn’t able to keep up, adding avoidable deaths to a second wave of Covid-19 that has devastated the country. The oxygen shortage seemed to have caught India off guard. That made the news in this pandemic, but India has run out of oxygen before. So why does this keep happening?

New York City looked a lot different in the 1960s and 1970s. A sharp economic decline and white flight meant there was mass disinvestment and urban decay, particularly in the city’s lower-income neighborhoods. It’s what Hattie Carthan and Liz Christy noticed in their communities when they each set out to revive their neighborhoods by making them greener. Ultimately, their radical acts of gardening would transform the landscape across New York City.

On December 4th, 1969, the Black Panther Party’s Illinois Chairman Fred Hampton was murdered by police. But his story is about much more than the raid that took his life. The movement Hampton helped create was unique, and revolutionary.

In the late 1960s, Fred Hampton helped lead a coalition of activists, working across racial lines against a corrupt city government that threatened their communities. At the core of their work were social programs, including free breakfasts, health clinics, and legal aid. Hampton named the group the Rainbow Coalition. And because of their impact, it wasn’t long before they got the attention of the police and the FBI. What followed was an assassination, and a coverup.

Subscribe to our channel! http://goo.gl/0bsAjO

In 2019, after ending Ethiopia’s decades-long war with its neighbor, Eritrea, Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize. It seemed like a new beginning for Ethiopia. After decades of dictatorships and oppressive regimes, he appeared to finally be putting the country on a new path.

But less than a year later, Abiy had already launched a military attack — on Tigray, a regional state in his own country. When Abiy became prime minister in 2018, he had largely supplanted Tigray’s main political party, the TPLF, as the country’s center of power. Since then, tensions between Abiy and the TPLF had escalated quickly. The political rivalry led to a dispute over an election, which led to an alleged attack on a military base — and finally to Abiy’s deployment of the military.

Abiy promised to bring peace to Ethiopia; now he’s presiding over a war that exploded from dispute to devastation in a matter of weeks, and has no obvious end in sight. Much of Tigray’s territory has been captured by local armies and militias. Thousands have died or fled their homes. And many Ethiopians are left wondering how Abiy, a leader who promised a break with the past, brought them here instead.

On January 4, 1976, a fleet of boats headed toward the Hawaiian island of Kaho‘olawe. The goal: take the island back from the US military for the Hawaiian people. 

Since World War II, the US military had used the island for bombing practice and decimated its land. But the story of the taking of this one island was part of a bigger history of the taking of all of Hawaii. The decades-long efforts to reclaim it would help spark a movement to renew the culture and traditions of the islands — and a push for Hawaiian sovereignty.

Monaco is the world’s second-smallest country, spanning only 2.2 square kilometers. Yet it's the capital of the wide world of car racing. 

For more than 70 years, the country has hosted the Monaco Grand Prix. It’s one of the world’s most unusual racecourses, running through the city streets of Monte Carlo. The course goes through a tunnel, up a cliff, and passes just feet from the harbor; it's earned the nickname “the race of a thousand corners.” 

Because of its design, the Monaco Grand Prix has produced some of the most memorable moments in car racing history. But that's not the only reason the race is so prestigious. 

Monaco is a tax haven, and for decades has been a favorite place for the rich and famous to stash their wealth. The Grand Prix weekend is the country's biggest weekend of the year, and the combination of a unique course and the world’s most famous people make the Grand Prix the world’s most prestigious car race.

Before Dodger Stadium, LA had Palo Verde, La Loma, and Bishop — three neighborhoods that made up a thriving, predominantly Mexican American community in an area known as Chavez Ravine. 

But in the late 1940s, the city marked that area as “blighted,” setting the stage for a decade-long battle by residents to preserve the community against threats of eviction. Ultimately, the city forced out residents with little to no compensation, clearing the way for the future baseball stadium.

The result is a complicated legacy, a story that's often missing from the history of Los Angeles, and for some, hard questions about what it means to be a fan of the LA Dodgers. Through interviews with several former residents of the area, this episode of Missing Chapter explores the story of the neighborhoods cleared to make way for the future chosen by the city.

It's not you — captchas really are getting harder. The worst part is that you’re partly to blame.

Correction: At 5:22, we say that Google uses reCaptcha V2 data to train their self-driving cars and improve Google maps. While they have used V2 tests to help improve Google maps, according to an email from a Waymo representative (Google’s self-driving car project), they aren’t using this image data to train their autonomous cars. For more on the future of self-driving cars, check out this article from Vox’s Kelsey Piper: https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2020/2/14/21063487/self-driving-cars-autonomous-vehicles-waymo-cruise-uber 

A captcha is a simple test that intends to distinguish between humans and computers. While the test itself is simple, there's a lot happening behind the scenes. The answers we give captchas end up being used to make AI smarter, thus ratcheting up the difficulty of future captcha tests.

But captchas can be broken by hackers. The tests we’re most familiar with already have been broken. Captcha makers try to stay ahead of the curve but have to balance increasing the difficulty of the test with making sure any person on earth — regardless of age, education, language, etc. — can still pass it. And eventually, they might have to phase out the test almost entirely.

Subscribe to our channel! http://goo.gl/0bsAjO

The US government has sent checks to millions of Americans during the economic crisis caused by the pandemic. But some economists are concerned that all that government spending could lead to inflation. If everyone suddenly has $1,200 more to spend, what will that do to the economy? Will it lead to prices going up, and money losing its value?

But the consensus among most economists, including those in charge of steering the US economy, is that we actually want some inflation. And to understand why, it helps to think of the US economy as a fish tank.

Have an idea for a story we should investigate for Missing Chapter? Tell us! http://bit.ly/2RhjxMy

From London, to Manila, to Melbourne, Chinatowns in cities around the world share similar design elements. And that’s on purpose. Their distinct ""Chinatown"" style can be traced back to a single event: the 1906 San Francisco earthquake, which came on the heels of decades of violence and racist laws targeting Chinese communities in the US. The earthquake devastated Chinatown. But in the destruction, San Francisco's Chinese businessmen had an idea for a fresh start: a way to keep their culture alive, by inventing a completely new one.

Chinatown carved out a place for itself under the threat of hate and violence. Today, that legacy is staring us in the face.

When you head out on the highway in the United States, you’re probably paying attention to the signs above your car and on the side of the road — the ones that direct you to your destination. If you’re looking for an exit or a rest stop, chances are you’ll see the typeface Highway Gothic. It became the highway standard in the 1950s, born out of an initiative from the California Department of Transportation to develop a clearer and more flexible standard for highway signs. 

But for the past decade, a new typeface has been trying to take its place: Clearview. This new typeface boasts wider spaces inside of letters and less chunky letterforms, and tries to solve some of Highway Gothic’s readability issues. Learn more in the video above.

Subscribe to our channel! http://goo.gl/0bsAjO

Early in the Covid-19 pandemic, many of the world’s richest countries poured money into the race for a vaccine. Billions of dollars, from programs like the US’s Operation Warp Speed, funded development that brought us multiple Covid-19 vaccines in record time. But it also determined where those vaccines would go. Before vaccine doses had even hit the market, places like the US and the UK had bought up nearly the entire supply.

This turns out to be an old story. In nearly every modern global health crisis, from smallpox to malaria to H1N1, rich countries have bought up vital medical supplies, making poor countries wait sometimes decades for life-saving support. It’s effectively a system in which where you live determines whether you live or die of a preventable disease. Leaving a disease like Covid-19 to spread unchecked in some places also gives it a chance to mutate -- and variants of the virus are already raising alarms. So: how do we get vaccines to countries that can’t afford them?

One solution underway is called Covax. It’s a program co-led by the World Health Organization; Gavi, The Vaccine Alliance; and the Coalition of Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI). Its goal is to get vaccines to lower- and middle-income countries at the same time as rich countries. So how is it supposed to do that? And will it be enough?

For the past several years scientists have been trying to account for the 8 million metric tonnes of plastic that we dump into the ocean each year. The assumption was that a large portion of it was floating out in one of the large garbage patches, where swirling debris accumulates thanks to ocean gyres. But recent measurements of the amount of trash in the patches fell far short of what’s thought to be out there. 

Scientists are getting closer to an answer, which could help clean-up efforts and prevent further damage to marine life and ocean ecosystems. 

In a previous version of this video, we mistakenly compared the size of the Great Pacific Garbage Patch to the area of Australia. It is in fact roughly 1.6 million square kilometers, a little more than twice the size of the state of Texas. A huge area, but not nearly as big as Australia.

“Ah, breaker one-nine, this here’s the Rubber Duck. You got a copy on me, Pigpen? C’mon.” This jumble of words is the first line of the song “Convoy,” a #1 country hit from 1976 that tells an action-packed story from the perspective of a truck driver. Songwriters Chip Davis and Bill Fries filled “Convoy” with banter and lingo based on communications they heard between trucker drivers on CB radio during the 1973 oil crisis.

The epic orchestration and colorful and quotable lyrics made “Convoy” an unlikely hit — but the song actually tapped into a long history of country music that put the spotlight on the solitary lives of long-haul truck drivers. In the video above, Estelle Caswell breaks down the golden era of trucker country with country and folk music scholars Travis Stimeling and Nate Gibson.

Late one evening in the summer of 1976, a Howard University student named Melvin Lindsey was tapped to fill in as a host at WHUR, the university-owned Black radio station. He chose a lineup of his favorite R&B ballads to soundtrack Washington, DC, that evening. The show was an accidental success. Shortly thereafter he was hired, and his show had a name: The Quiet Storm. 

Quiet Storm radio shows have since become a staple of Black communities across the United States. In the video above Estelle Caswell, along with ethnomusicologist Fredara Hadley, break down exactly what makes Quiet Storm such a beloved black radio tradition. Also featured in the episode are radio hosts, Angela Stribling, Al Wood, and John Monds.

For decades, South Africa was under apartheid: a series of laws that divided people by race. Then, in the 1990s, those laws were dismantled. But many of the barriers they created continue to divide South Africans by skin color - which in turn determines their quality of life, access to jobs, and wealth. Racial division was built into the fabric of cities throughout South Africa, and it still hasn't been uprooted.

That's partly because, while apartheid was the culmination of South Africa's racial divisions, it wasn't the beginning of them. That story starts closer to the 1800s, when the British built a network of railroads that transformed the region's economy into one that excluded most Black people -- and then made that exclusion the law.

Hart Island, a small piece of land off the Bronx in New York City, resurfaced in national headlines in April 2020, when New York City was the epicenter of the US coronavirus pandemic. News footage of the island’s cemetery showed trenches being filled with pine coffins, and sent shockwaves around the world. But these mass burials taking place during the pandemic are just the most recent in Hart Island’s long history. 

Hart Island’s “potter’s field” cemetery dates back to 1869, and for over 150 years has served as a burial ground for over 1 million New Yorkers. Over the years, infrastructure problems and a lack of reliable public access have earned Hart Island a tainted reputation. 

A 2021 analysis by Columbia Journalism School’s Stabile Center and THE CITY found that over 2,300 New Yorkers were buried on Hart Island in 2020. That’s more burials than any year during the AIDS epidemic, another recent health crisis. They also found that New York City is on pace to bury one in 1 in 10 Covid-19 victims on the island. The analysis of these burials shows who is more likely to be buried on Hart Island: Black and Latino residents, frontline workers, and those who have little access to health care.  

To understand how this ties together and what’s next for Hart Island, watch the video above. 

This story was produced in collaboration with THE CITY and Columbia Journalism School’s Stabile Center of Investigative Journalism, as part of “MISSING THEM,” THE CITY’s ongoing collaborative project to remember every New Yorker killed by COVID-19.

✉️ Sign up for our newsletter: http://www.vox.com/video-newsletter

In February 1959 a group of hikers disappeared in the remote Ural Mountains of Western Siberia. A search party found their tent weeks later, abandoned along with all of their equipment. Frozen bodies were found 1,500 meters away, mysteriously underdressed for the weather conditions: most weren’t wearing shoes or gloves, and some were just in their sleeping clothes. Even stranger, three of the hikers had suffered major internal trauma — broken ribs and a fractured skull — and two were wearing clothes contaminated with radioactive substances. 

Nonetheless, the lead Soviet investigator closed the criminal case into the hikers’ deaths, concluding that an “overwhelming force” is what drove them from the tent. Theories ranging from rare weather events to conspiracy to UFOs have developed ever since, to explain what is now called the Dyatlov Pass incident. But two plausible theories, each involving an “overwhelming force” may finally explain what happened that night. 

It could have been a delayed slab avalanche. The hikers dug a platform into the slope of Kholat Syakhl to pitch the tent, and a scientific model published in January 2021 demonstrates that this, combined with strong downslope winds that accumulated snow above the tent, triggered a deadly slab avalanche. This type of avalanche can occur even in places not known for avalanches and can cause injuries consistent with the ones some of the hikers sustained. 

It also could have been a strong “katabatic wind,” a powerful wind that travels down a mountain slope, picking up speed under the force of gravity. In this scenario, a strong wind can become near-hurricane level very suddenly. If this happened the night of the incident, it could explain why the hikers would have abandoned their tent so quickly, as the powerful wind would potentially tear the tent apart. The mysterious internal injuries that some sustained are explained by a snow den the hikers dug for shelter collapsing on top of them. 

Both theories offer potential solutions for what drove the hikers to suddenly abandon their tent, and why some were so severely injured. Ultimately though, since there were no survivors, many of the questions surrounding the case will likely never be answered.

K3odScka55A,Vox,UCLXo7UDZvByw2ixzpQCufnA,Why you can't compare Covid-19 vaccines,2021-03-20 12:00:13+00:00,"What a vaccine's ""efficacy rate"" actually means.

Sign up for our newsletter: http://www.vox.com/video-newsletter

In the US, the first two available Covid-19 vaccines were the ones from Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna. Both vaccines have very high ""efficacy rates,"" of around 95%. But the third vaccine introduced in the US, from Johnson & Johnson, has a considerably lower efficacy rate: just 66%.

Look at those numbers next to each other, and it's natural to conclude that one of them is considerably worse. Why settle for 66% when you can have 95%? But that isn't the right way to understand a vaccine's efficacy rate, or even to understand what a vaccine does. And public health experts say that if you really want to know which vaccine is the best one, efficacy isn't actually the most important number at all.

✉️ Sign up for our newsletter: http://www.vox.com/video-newsletter

In December of 2020, China and Nepal made a joint announcement about a new measurement for Mount Everest: 8,849 meters. This is just the latest of several different surveys of Everest since the first measurement was taken in 1855. The reasons why the height has fluctuated have to do with surveying methodology, challenges in determining sea level, and the people who have historically been able to measure Everest. 

We mention this NOAA post in the end tag of the video, which addresses another way to measure the height of mountains: https://oceanservice.noaa.gov/facts/highestpoint.html

vaNOuVgwPos,Vox,UCLXo7UDZvByw2ixzpQCufnA,The bridge design that helped win World War II,2021-03-12 13:00:16+00:00,"It’s a simple innovation that helped win a war.

The Bailey bridge was Donald Bailey’s innovative solution to a number of wartime obstacles. The allies needed a way to cross bodies of water quickly, but bombed-out bridges — or an absence of crossings entirely — made that incredibly difficult. That was only compounded by new, heavy tanks that needed incredibly strong support.

Bailey’s innovation — a modular, moveable panel bridge — solved those problems and gave the allies a huge advantage. The 570-pound steel panel could be lifted by just six men, and the supplies could fit inside small service trucks. Using those manageable materials, soldiers could build crossings sufficient for heavy tanks and other vehicles.

As impressive, the Bailey bridge could be rolled across a gap from one side to the other, making it possible to build covertly or with little access to the other side. Together, all the Bailey bridge’s advantages changed bridge construction and may have helped win the war.

Further reading: 

John A. Thierry’s contemporaneous history of the Bailey Bridge provides a great overview:

This Army Manual is a great look at how the Bailey Bridge worked:

https://www.icevirtuallibrary.com/doi/abs/10.1680/ciwv1.45170.0022

Denys Begbie and Gwilym Roberts’ paper is a great summary of the Bailey Bridge’s achievements.

As of March 2021, Covid-19 has killed more than 2.5 million people. It’s brought on a dramatic economic downfall, a mental health crisis, and has generally just put the world on pause. But we don’t have to look far back in history to see how much worse it could have been.

Smallpox was twice as contagious as Covid-19, and over 60 times as deadly. It plagued humanity for centuries, left many survivors blinded and covered in scars, and killed hundreds of millions of people in the 20th century alone. But today, smallpox has been eradicated. Through a massive global effort, we were able to wipe the disease completely out of existence.

So can we do the same thing with Covid-19? And if we can’t, what are our other options?

✉️ Sign up for our newsletter: http://www.vox.com/video-newsletter

In February, extreme cold and an unusual winter storm left millions of Texans in the dark. Many went without power or water, in subzero temperatures, for nearly five days. It was a disaster; dozens died. But even though that storm hit much of the country, the power outages were mostly limited to Texas. That’s because Texas is on its own electrical grid, separate from the rest of the country, which means it can’t easily get power from other states in an emergency.

But Texas's grid itself is not what failed. Power went out across Texas in the first place because energy sources across the state were unprepared for severe weather. And that didn’t have to happen; Texas had been warned about this exact scenario, and had actually experienced versions of it twice in the last 30 years. But they didn’t prepare.

Now the rest of the US faces the same issue. Climate change is making severe weather disasters more and more frequent. And the American energy system is not ready for it.

Gift shops are like the final exhibit of an art museum. They’re often located toward the exit and are unmissable on your way out the door. Souvenirs inside can range from Vincent Van Gogh socks to giant stuffed soup cans to Mona Lisa rubber ducks. But how do gift shop curators decide what to sell? 

Stocking decisions often revolve around how curators want visitors to perceive the art lining museum walls. When you see a certain piece of art on a lot of merchandise, that usually means curators think that artwork is important. And thanks to a psychological phenomenon called the mere-exposure effect, the more you see that art, the more you begin to think it’s important.

Subscribe to our channel! http://goo.gl/0bsAjO

In 2006, a lawyer named Alexei Navalny started a blog where he wrote about corruption in his home country of Russia. It’s the most prominent problem under the regime of Vladimir Putin, who has ruled Russia since 2000. Putin has systematically taken over the country’s independent media, oligarchy, elections, and laws to cement his own power and wield corruption to his advantage. 

That’s what Navalny set out to expose. And in 2010, he published a groundbreaking investigation into a state-owned transportation company, Transneft, which was funneling state money into the hands of its executives. The post launched Navalny into politics. 

By 2016, he had become the face of Russia’s opposition movement, run for mayor, and was running for president against Putin himself. Navalny was unifying Russia’s opposition like no politician had before. That’s why the Kremlin tried to kill him. Navalny survived the assassination attempt, launching a movement never before seen in Russia.

Subscribe to Vox and turn on notifications (🔔) so you don't miss any videos: http://goo.gl/0bsAjO​

On December 26, 1908, American boxer Jack Johnson became the first Black heavyweight champion of the world, after defeating defending champion Tommy Burns in a title fight in Sydney, Australia. Black fighters were typically denied the chance to win the heavyweight title, a de-facto line of segregation that was known as “the color line.” So when Burns accepted Johnson’s challenge and lost, the film that was distributed around the fight proved controversial. 

The white boxing world set out to find a white heavyweight to beat Johnson and take back the title. That white fighter ended up being James Jeffries, a former heavyweight champion who had retired undefeated. 

Their fight, hyped as the “Battle of the Century,” took place in Reno, Nevada, on July 4, 1910, in front of 20,000 mostly-white spectators and nine motion picture cameras. Throughout the nation, many thousands more listened to live telegram bulletins of each round. Johnson beat Jeffries easily, and, as a result, racist mob violence broke out across the country, and Black Americans celebrating Johnson’s win were attacked, and some were killed. 

The film of the fight became notorious worldwide and was the most talked-about motion picture of its time. Johnson lost the heavyweight title in 1915 after successfully defending it eight times, but remained an inspiration for many fighters to come.

Subscribe to our channel! http://goo.gl/0bsAjO

Like many coastal cities around the world, Jakarta is dealing with sea level rise. But Indonesia's biggest city also has a unique problem: Because of restricted water access in the city, the majority of its residents have to extract groundwater to survive. And it's causing the city to sink. Today, Jakarta is the world’s fastest-sinking city.

The problem gets worse every year, but the root of it precedes modern Indonesia by centuries. In the 1600s, when the Dutch landed in Indonesia and built present-day Jakarta, they divided up the city to segregate the population. Eventually, that segregation led to an unequal water piping system that excluded most Indigenous Jakartans, forcing them to find other ways to get water.

To understand how it all ties together, and what’s in store for Jakarta’s future, watch the video above.

As the above video shows, these lenses satisfied a need for lighthouses that could shine farther and through dense layers of fog. The Fresnel lens, invented by Augustin-Jean Fresnel, helped do that by capturing all the light coming from a lamp, and then magnifying and directing it in one direction. Suddenly, lighthouses became more useful and shipwrecks diminished.

Even today, this breakthrough is still in operation. As the US Lighthouse Society reports, more than 75 Fresnel lenses are in use in American lighthouses, and businesses like Dan Spinella’s of Artworks Florida craft replicas that capture the beauty — and functionality — of the 19th-century breakthrough.

Watch the above video to learn how these lenses work and how they saved lives.

Every vaccine can have side effects like muscle pain, fever, or headaches; and some of the new Covid-19 vaccines are even likelier to give you those side effects than you may be used to. But the scientists who work most closely with vaccines emphasize that when a vaccination makes you feel sick, it's almost never a bad sign. And once you understand why vaccine side effects happen, you may even be happy to get that headache.

Subscribe and turn on notifications (🔔 ) so you don't miss any videos: http://goo.gl/0bsAjO

Researchers working on Covid-19 vaccines have smashed speed records, bringing new vaccines from development to distribution in less than a year. They did this with the help of billions of dollars of unprecedented global investment -- but also, in some cases, with a new type of vaccine technology.

There are four traditional types of vaccines, and they all require the growing and handling of live pathogens in a lab, a time-consuming process than can add months or years to development. But two new types of vaccines skip that step altogether by moving that work from the lab to our bodies. mRNA vaccines, like the ones from Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna; and Adenovirus vaccines, like those from Johnson & Johnson and AstraZeneca; do this by sending genetic instructions directly into our cells, which then produce the harmless protein the body needs to learn to fight Covid-19. Because these proteins are produced from within cells rather than injected from the outside, they may be less likely to provoke adverse reactions in the recipient.

The result has been a host of vaccines developed faster than ever. But it's also ushered us into a new age of vaccine technology, one in which we can send our own bodies the instructions on how to protect themselves. That technology is already being used to drive research on vaccines for HIV and cancer. These new types of vaccines are weapons we developed to fight the coronavirus - but their real impact is just beginning.

Subscribe to Vox and turn on notifications (🔔) so you don't miss any videos: http://goo.gl/0bsAjO

Scientific progress in the 18th century in Europe, a period known as the “Age of Enlightenment,” was demystifying the universe with breakthroughs in chemistry, physics, and philosophy. But medical practices were still relying on centuries-old treatments, like leeching and bloodletting, which were painful and often ineffective. So when Franz Anton Mesmer, a charismatic physician from Vienna, began “healing” people in Paris using an alternative therapeutic practice he called “animal magnetism,” it got a lot of attention. 

Mesmer claimed that an invisible magnetic fluid was the life force that connected all things and that he had the power to regulate it to restore health in his patients. He was a celebrity figure until the King of France, Louis XVI, commissioned a group of leading scientists to investigate his methods in 1784. 

Benjamin Franklin headed the commission, and they debunked the existence of the magnetic fluid in the first-known blind experiment. Mesmer was ruined, but “mesmerism” didn’t end there. The report also acknowledged that Mesmer’s methods were making his patients feel better, which they attributed to the power of the human imagination. This experiment ultimately laid the groundwork for our understanding of the placebo effect and inspired an evolution of Mesmer’s practice into something more recognizable today: hypnotism.

How do visual effects artists match their digital creations to real light? Sometimes, it involves using a very shiny ball.

Leo Bovell of Tryptyc has worked on a range of visual effects projects, but one of his most memorable experiences might be shooting in the Lincoln Memorial for an episode of “The Handmaid’s Tale.” His task? Replace the real Lincoln with a completely digital — and destroyed — version.  To do it, he used an industry-standard HDRI map of the light in the scene.

HDRIs — high dynamic range images — mesh together different pictures to create a complete depiction of the light in a real scene. After that, it’s a matter of teaching a computer to cast that light onto digital objects. This technique is used for everything from creating entire scenes to providing key references for artists.

Watch the above video to learn more.

Further Reading:
Paul Debevec is a visual effects pioneer for a wide range of projects, including creating the first digital portrait of the president of the United States. His work in HDRIs was equally groundbreaking, and he catalogs it and other work on his personal website.

Large libraries of these digital scenes make it possible to simulate a wide range of environments. HDRI Haven provides more than a few worlds to explore.

Law enforcement agencies have said they had ""no intelligence"" indicating that a group of Trump supporters would overpower police and enter the US Capitol building on January 6, 2021. But journalists and researchers who study the online far right say that's not true. In fact, the groups at the heart of the riot had been planning it for days, in plain sight, on social media -- and the signs that an event like this was imminent had been coming for years.

Reporters Logan Jaffe (ProPublica) and Robert Evans (Bellingcat) describe the warning signs they observed weeks, months, and even years before a mob of Trump supporters broke into the US Capitol building.

Subscribe to our channel! http://goo.gl/0bsAjO

For most of its nearly 50-year history, the Clean Water Act protected all US rivers and streams from pollution. But the Trump administration redefined the types of waterways that get federal protection, which affects some states in the arid West more than any other part of the country. The reason why has to do with the differences between certain types of rivers and streams.

Subscribe to our channel! http://goo.gl/0bsAjO

In November 2020, thousands of farmers marched from the northern states of India to Delhi to protest farming reforms passed by Prime Minister Modi’s government. Those protests have continued throughout the month of December and show little sign of letting up. The farmers have set up camp in and around the capital city to pressure the government to repeal the laws, but the government won’t budge. 

The government says these new laws will modernize farming by liberalizing the industry, but India’s farmers say it will be their downfall. Under these new policies, farmers will have fewer government protections and will likely lose the government-regulated markets and prices they have relied on for decades. 

To make matters even more difficult, all this is happening as India’s farmers grapple with a shrinking share of the economy that has contributed to a suicide crisis around the country. 

To understand the three farming reforms and why they have driven so many farmers into the streets, as well as the history behind the problems farmers have been facing for decades, watch the video above.

Read Sara’s article about the privacy settings on your smart speaker: https://www.vox.com/recode/2020/12/9/22160427/amazon-alexa-google-assistant-siri-holidays

Correction: At 0:58, we mistakenly suggest that every 1 in 5 American households has a smart speaker. In fact, over one-third of U.S. adults has a smart speaker. We regret the error.

In 2014, Amazon debuted a simple but industry-changing product: the smart speaker. Technically the Amazon Echo was just a microphone attached to the internet that you installed in your home. But it let users ask a digital assistant, Alexa, thousands of questions and commands, and it was a hit. Before long, Google and Apple followed with their own smart speakers, and today, a device that began as a curiosity has become commonplace: one in five US households now owns a smart speaker.

Smart speakers offer convenience; much of their popularity can simply be chalked up to that. But tech companies are also clearly pushing the technology onto consumers hard, sometimes selling smart speakers at rock-bottom prices, and building the “listening” technology that drives them into all sorts of other products, from headphones to doorbells. And a big reason for that is all the data that they produce.

Just like our web searches, online purchases, and social networks, every command you give to a smart speaker is a new piece of data that tech companies own. Most likely, your voice recordings are already being used for improving those companies’ listening algorithms and ad targeting, but there’s very little transparency and no way to know exactly how they use human voice data. All we really know is that these devices have enabled their manufacturers to collect gigantic troves of voice recordings — and that opting out of it isn’t always easy.

Subscribe to our channel! http://goo.gl/0bsAjO

The US 2020 election isn't completely over. That’s because, even though we know Joe Biden will be president, we still don’t know if he’ll have a friendly Congress to work with. Congress’s lower chamber, the House of Representatives, is under Democratic control. But control of the upper chamber, the Senate, is still up in the air, because of two remaining Senate races — and they’re both in the state of Georgia.

The results of those “runoff” elections -- one between Democrat Jon Ossoff and Republican David Perdue, the other between Democrat Raphael Warnock and Republican Kelly Loeffler --  will determine whether Biden’s policy agenda will be ambitious or compromised. But runoff elections are actually really rare in the US. And the story of why Georgia uses them in the first place is crucial to understanding the state that will now determine the next several years of American politics.

Watching someone play a game in virtual reality is a bit of a surreal experience in itself. They swing their arms around, turn their heads, and twist their bodies reacting to invisible cues all around them. From outside the headset, you might be able to see their experience on a screen. But it’s hard to believe that they could become so immersed in a virtual world that they lose track of reality around them — and yet it happens all the time.

The internet is full of “virtual reality fails” — people falling into walls and crashing through their TVs, much to their families' disbelief. Virtual reality harnesses our perception in ways video games and other media can’t. Check out the video above to learn more.

QTA8j5wSTx4,Vox,UCLXo7UDZvByw2ixzpQCufnA,"Napoleon's missing hand, explained",2020-12-18 13:00:08+00:00,"Napoleon Bonaparte was often depicted concealing a hand inside his shirt. Why?

Subscribe to our channel! http://goo.gl/0bsAjO

Napoleon Bonaparte is one of history’s most famous figures and has been depicted in countless portraits. Often, paintings show him with one hand concealed inside his shirt. The gesture is a common feature of caricatures and impressions of the conqueror, and its frequent appearance has led to speculation about why he seemed to do it so often. 

The answer is rooted in the gesture’s history. Concealing a hand in one’s coat has long signified gentlemanly restraint, and was often associated with nobility. It goes as far back as ancient Greece, when famed orator Aeschines claimed that restricting the movement of one’s hand was the proper way to speak in public. 

Portraits of Napoleon adopting this pose are an example of propaganda — the most famous version being Jacques-Louis David’s 1812 painting of Napoleon in his study. It portrays the ruler as a modest and hardworking leader, even though outside of France Napoleon was often labeled a tyrant and considered to be ill-tempered. The hand-in-waistcoat gesture became a common way to depict him during his lifetime and long after he died. 

The pose also became a portraiture cliché with the advent of photography, thanks to its dignified reputation — and because it was a good way to sit still during the long exposure times of early photography.

Im Jahr 1919 verhalf eine totale Sonnenfinsternis der Schwerkraft zu einer neuen Definition.

Albert Einsteins allgemeine Relativitätstheorie, die 1915 erschien, definierte Schwerkraft als Einwirkung massiver Körper, wie beispielsweise Planeten und Sterne, die den Raum, der sie umgibt, krümmen. Diese Definition wich komplett von der Isaac Newtons ab, der Schwerkraft über 200 Jahre früher als eine anziehende Kraft beschrieben hatte, die Planeten und Sterne in ihrer gegenseitigen Umlaufbahn hält. Wenn Einstein Recht hatte, würde sich auch Licht in der Nähe massiver Körper krümmen. Im Jahr 1919 machten sich zwei Britische Expeditionen auf, diese Hypothese zu überprüfen, indem sie eine totale Sonnenfinsternis fotografierten. Durch einen Vergleich der Stellung bestimmter Sterne, einmal mit der Sonne vor ihnen, und einmal mit der Sonne anderweitig positioniert, konnten Arthur Eddington und sein Team beweisen, dass sich die scheinbar fixe Position der Sterne während der Sonnenfinsternis bewegte. Dies war das erste, wenngleich nicht das letzte Mal, dass Einsteins allgemeine Relativitätstheorie überprüft und bewiesen wurde. Einstein wurde über Nacht zur Berühmtheit und sollte für den Rest seines Lebens eine Ikone der Popkultur bleiben.

Washington D. C. stand noch nie so kurz davor, ein Bundesstaat zu werden. Könnte das schon bald wirklich passieren?

Abonniert unseren Kanal! http://goo.gl/0bsAjO

Am 26. Juni 2020 stimmte das US-Repräsentantenhaus dafür, Amerikas Hauptstadt Washington D. C. zum 51. Bundesstaat der Vereinigten Staaten zu machen. Hierbei handelte es sich um ein historisches Votum, in der das Land – 60 Jahre nach der letzten Aufnahme eines Staates – dieser Entscheidung näher gekommen ist als je zuvor. Zunächst jedoch nur symbolisch, denn zumindest im Jahr 2020 hat D. C. keine Chance, ein Staat zu werden.

Die Abstimmung verlief am 26. Juni fast ausschließlich nach parteipolitischen Gesichtspunkten; während die Demokraten größtenteils für die Staatlichkeit von D. C. stimmten, waren die Republikaner dagegen. Das hängt damit zusammen, dass die Demokraten durch die Schaffung von D. C. als Bundesstaat zusätzliche Sitze im Kongress erhalten und dadurch das Machtverhältnis zwischen den Parteien beeinträchtigt würde. Aus diesem Grund haben Präsident Trump und der von den Republikanern kontrollierte Senat versprochen, jeden Vorschlag D. C. zu einem Bundesstaat zu machen, abzulehnen. Staatlichkeit war in den USA schon immer ein politisches Thema. In der Vergangenheit fügten die Amerikaner Staaten vorwiegend paarweise hinzu, um das politische Gleichgewicht zu erhalten. In diesem Zuge kam es zwar vor, dass ein einzelner Bundesstaat zugelassen wurde, dies zählte jedoch eher zu den Ausnahmen.

Dennoch sprechen starke Argumente für die Staatlichkeit in D. C.: Die Stadt hat eine ähnlich hohe Bevölkerungszahl wie andere Bundesstaaten; die über hunderttausend Einwohner haben bei der nationalen Gesetzgebung kein Mitspracherecht; die lokale Regierung ist immer der Gefahr ausgesetzt, von dem Kongress sowie der Regierung überwältigt zu werden. Vereinfacht gesagt, die Gesetze, die den Bezirk damals schufen, sahen es nicht vor, dass aus Washington D. C. eines Tages eine Großstadt wird. Als 1993 das letzte Mal im Kongress über die Staatlichkeit abgestimmt wurde, war das demokratisch kontrollierte Abgeordnetenhaus noch dagegen – aktuell wäre die","['D.

Abonniert unseren Kanal! http://goo.gl/0bsAjO

Gibt es eine richtige Art und Weise, Monopoly zu spielen?
Brian Valentine versucht sich an einer Antwort — Valentine war Vertreter der Vereinigten Staaten bei den Monopoly-Weltmeisterschaften 2015, wo er den dritten Platz belegte. Wie im obigen Video zu sehen, bedeutet Monopoly zu spielen, alle Regeln neu zu erlernen, Schlüsselstrategien zu verinnerlichen und vor allem Deine Mitspieler/innen wertzuschätzen.

Valentine teilt mit uns sein Wissen über Wahrscheinlichkeits-Heatmaps (Diagramme die Aufschluss über die Wahrscheinlichkeit geben, auf einem bestimmten Spielfeld zu landen), über die Feinheiten von Spielzügen rund um Häuser und Hotels, und er bietet sogar ein paar Tipps dazu, wie man Spiele für alle Beteiligten spaßig und nicht erbittert gestaltet.  
Weiterführende Literatur:

Es gibt massenweise Artikel, die die Mathematik hinter Monopoly verständlich erklären. Während Mathematik nicht der einzige Bestandteil ist, den man benötigt, um Monopoly richtig zu spielen, ist sie ein extrem wichtiger. Dieser Artikel aus dem Business Insider von Walt Hickey ist eine fantastische Einführung, und dieser Artikel aus Thrillist von Daisy Barringer bietet darüber hinaus noch viele weitere gute Tipps.

Correction: At 2:13, we wrote Parkour DBX. It should read ""Parkour DXB.""

Christian Devaux and Damien Devaux founded World Chase Tag after being inspired by their own backyard games of tag. From there, it grew from a hobby into a sport with an athletic talent pool — parkour athletes — that had long been ignored. Now there are terms, strategies, and even a media infrastructure surrounding the classic playground game.

Strategies for World Chase Tag draw from the parkour tradition but also from influences as varied as ball sports and gymnastics. It’s a game that’s quickly developing a vocabulary, from “idling” to “herding,” as well as unique personalities. Recently, World Chase Tag made its American television debut on NBC SN.

But for the Devaux brothers, it all stems from that initial passion for a backyard game that was exciting enough to become a sport watched by millions.

wmSXB7ukH4M,Vox,UCLXo7UDZvByw2ixzpQCufnA,Why Poland is having huge protests,2020-12-08 13:00:13+00:00,"The country’s women are furious at their government.

Subscribe to our channel! http://goo.gl/0bsAjO

In October and November of 2020, Poland saw its biggest protests since the fall of its communist regime 30 years ago. Hundreds of thousands of women marched in defiance of a new court ruling that would outlaw abortions under almost any circumstance.

Poland has long had some of the strictest abortion laws in Europe. But in 2015, the right-wing party Law and Justice (PiS) came to power in Poland, and promptly started trying to narrow abortion access in the country even further. In 2016 they attempted to pass a total ban. They failed.

But in 2020, at the ruling party’s request, Poland’s highest court ruled that almost all abortions were illegal. They did so because Law and Justice had spent the previous few years degrading the court’s independence and turning it into an arm of the party. The protests began immediately, partly because of the ruling itself but also because of what it represents: the risk of losing not only reproductive rights but the country’s democratic institutions.

To understand why this ruling has driven so many into the streets, and exactly why it threatens Poland’s democracy, watch the video above. 

Note: At 1:50, a previous version of this video illustrated a quote from Law & Justice party leader Jarosław Kaczyński with a photo of his late twin brother, former president Lech Kaczyński. The error has been corrected.

JHveTVe542Y,Vox,UCLXo7UDZvByw2ixzpQCufnA,There’s a female orgasm shortage. Why? [Advertiser content from Bellesa],2020-12-08 00:15:01+00:00,"The orgasm has been called many things: a little death, heaven, high tide. No matter what you call it, an orgasm is, basically, a rush of endorphins and pleasure stemming from genitalia stimulus. The orgasm is a deeply beautiful and incredibly beneficial human reaction, but not everyone gets to experience them equally: Women are having fewer orgasms than men when they have sex with men.

Pornography and sexualized imagery is a readily accessible medium that can be clicked into by anyone at any given time. Because it is widely available—and sex education isn’t—we as humans emulate what we see as the norm. Far too often, male orgasm is the purpose of most heterosexual pornographic videos with women’s pleasure residing in niche categories.

With accessible imagery that props up men’s orgasms as a must-have and women’s as nonexistent—along with a lack of sex education—the consumer internalizes this messaging and acts upon it as the norm. Does life really imitate art? It sure can. In a 2018 study of newlywed heterosexual couples, 87 percent of men reported consistently experiencing orgasms, compared to only 49 percent of women.

This is what we call The Pleasure Gap, i.e., the disparity between cisgender men and women in terms of sexual satisfaction. Sure, anyone could point to the female orgasm being harder or more difficult to achieve based being nonexistent in porn, feature films, and television shows, but truly it’s just a lack of representation as the male and female orgasm takes just as much effort to achieve when engaging in solo play: 4 minutes.

Subscribe to our channel! http://goo.gl/0bsAjO

American law specifies that the US presidential election happens in early November. It also specifies that the winner of that election isn’t actually sworn in until January 20th. That leaves about two and a half months in between, where, in situations where the incumbent has been voted out, the winner of the election still isn’t president. This is the “transition” period, during which the old administration trades places with the new one.

But does that period really need to be so long? In 2020, we found out what happens when an incumbent president loses reelection, but refuses to concede: Among other things, it pushes the start of the transition several weeks later, shortening that handover period. So does that matter? What actually happens in those two and a half months, and why do we let the loser continue to wield power for so long?

Subscribe to our channel! http://goo.gl/0bsAjO

Nagorno-Karabakh is a mountainous area in the Caucasus region between Europe and Asia. For more than 30 years, it's been locked in a conflict between Armenia and Azerbaijan. The fight between the two countries began in the early 20th century but became a frozen conflict for 60 years while the whole region was under the control of the Soviet Union. 

When the Soviet Union fell, newfound independence sparked a brutal six-year war in the region, where Armenia emerged victorious. From 1994 to 2020, Armenia controlled Nagorno-Karabakh, while Azerbaijan rebuilt its military. Fighting erupted again in summer 2020, and Azerbaijan went on the offensive — eventually capturing most of Nagorno-Karabakh and dramatically reshaping the region.

En 1919, un eclipse solar total ayudó a redefinir la gravedad.

La teoría de la relatividad general de Albert Einstein, publicada en 1915, definía la gravedad como la influencia de objetos masivos, como planetas y estrellas, que curvaban el espacio a su alrededor. Esto era muy diferente de la forma en que Isaac Newton había definido la gravedad más de 200 años antes: Newton describió una fuerza de atracción que mantenía a los planetas y las estrellas en órbita entre sí. Si Einstein tenía razón, entonces la luz también se doblaría cerca de objetos masivos. Y en 1919, dos expediciones británicas se propusieron probarlo fotografiando un eclipse solar total. Al comparar la posición de las estrellas con el sol frente a ellas y otra con el sol en otra parte, Arthur Eddington y su equipo demostraron que las posiciones aparentes de las estrellas se movieron durante el eclipse. Esta fue la primera, pero no la última vez que se probó y comprobó la teoría de la relatividad general de Einstein, y Einstein se convirtió en una celebridad de la noche a la mañana. Y siguió siendo un ícono de la cultura pop por el resto de su vida.

¿Existe una forma correcta de jugar al Monopoly?

Brian Valentine intenta dar una respuesta: fue el representante de Estados Unidos en el campeonato mundial de Monopoly de 2015, donde obtuvo un tercer lugar. Como muestra el video anterior, jugar correctamente al Monopoly implica volver a aprender las reglas, procesar estrategias clave y, sobre todo, valorar a las personas con las que juegas.

Valentine comparte su conocimiento sobre los diagramas de probabilidad que muestran la probabilidad de aterrizar en un determinado espacio, los matices del juego en casas y hoteles, e incluso algunos consejos para hacer que los juegos sean divertidos en lugar de rencorosos.

Washington DC está más cerca que nunca de convertirse en un estado. ¿Podría suceder realmente?

¡Suscríbete a nuestro canal! http://goo.gl/0bsAjO

El 26 de junio de 2020, la Cámara de Representantes de Estados Unidos votó para convertir a la capital de Estados Unidos, Washington, DC, en el estado número 51 del país. Fue una votación histórica, y lo más cerca que ha estado el país de agregar un nuevo estado en más de 60 años. Pero también fue, por el momento, completamente simbólico. Porque al menos en 2020, DC no tiene ninguna posibilidad de convertirse en un estado.

Aquella votación del 26 de junio se desarrolló casi por completo en líneas partidarias. La mayoría de los demócratas votaron a favor de la estadidad de DC y los republicanos en contra. Eso es porque convertir a DC en un estado les daría a los demócratas escaños adicionales en el Congreso, lo que podría afectar el equilibrio de poder entre los partidos. Es por eso que el presidente Trump y el Senado controlado por los republicanos han prometido rechazar cualquier intento de convertirse en un Estado de DC. Y de hecho, la estadidad en los Estados Unidos siempre ha sido un tema político. En el pasado, Estados Unidos a menudo ha agregado estados en pares para preservar el equilibrio político. Admitir un nuevo estado por sí solo ha sucedido, pero es inusual.

Pero el caso a favor de la estadidad de DC es sólido: la ciudad tiene una población similar a la de varios estados, sus cientos de miles de residentes carecen de voz en la elaboración de leyes nacionales y su gobierno local es especialmente vulnerable a ser reforzado por el Congreso y el gobierno federal. En pocas palabras, las leyes que crearon el distrito no anticiparon que algún día sería una ciudad importante. Y mientras que en 1993, la última vez que el Congreso votó sobre la estadidad de DC, la Cámara controlada por los demócratas no la aprobó, el Partido Demócrata de hoy está cada vez más de acuerdo con ella. Si las elecciones de 2020 ponen a los demócratas en pleno control del gobierno federal, Estados Unidos podría obtener su estado número 51.

Subscribe to our channel! http://goo.gl/0bsAjO
 
Roger Fenton’s 1855 photo “The Valley of the Shadow of Death” is the first famous photograph of war, depicting a barren road littered with cannonballs fired during the Crimean War. But there’s a second photo of the same road with no cannonballs, which has led photo historians, and, notably, American writer and filmmaker Susan Sontag, to claim that the famed photo is staged. Meaning, the photo with no cannonballs was taken first, and the photo with cannonballs was arranged and taken second.

American documentary film director Errol Morris went down a rabbit hole of interviews and photo analysis to determine if that order of the photos – with cannonballs “OFF” the road first, then “ON” – is accurate, based solely on what’s present in the photographs themselves.

For 126 years, Mississippi’s state flag prominently featured the Confederate battle emblem in its design. That emblem is the most enduring and recognizable symbol of the American Civil War, a four-year conflict in which Southern states fought to preserve slavery in the United States. 

Since then, the symbol has been used as a banner of Southern pride but is also widely used by white supremacists to honor a time when Black Americans were enslaved. Activists in Mississippi have protested the state flag for decades, and it almost changed in 2001, when an alternative design was presented but failed to get enough votes to replace the old one. 

After the 2015 massacre of nine Black churchgoers in South Carolina and the uprising in 2020 in response to the murder of George Floyd, Mississippi’s legislature finally abolished the state flag bearing the Confederate emblem. On November 3, 2020, Mississippi voters approved a new flag design that’s more inclusive and reflective of the people across the state.

Watch more of our election coverage: http://vox.com/ElectionVideos

On November 3, four American states voted to legalize marijuana: Arizona, New Jersey, Montana and South Dakota. Combined with the other states that have done so in recent years, one in three Americans now live in a state where access to marijuana has been legalized. It shows that Americans are souring on the harsh drug policies that have put millions of people in prison.

But America’s national drug policy is a different story. Under federal law, marijuana is still classified as a “schedule 1” drug, meaning it’s considered to have little medical value and a high risk of abuse, along with drugs like LSD, heroin, ecstasy and psilocybin mushrooms. In states where marijuana has been legalized, that conflict with federal law creates numerous problems for legal marijuana sellers and users. And few national politicians talk about legalizing marijuana throughout the country. But advocates are hoping that by introducing new state laws one by one, Americans who are ready to move on from the country’s decades-long war on drugs will eventually force the federal government’s hand.

[Advertiser content from Allstate],2020-11-09 23:00:05+00:00,"Most people learn essential safety lessons starting from a young age. We’re taught to look both ways before crossing the street, cover our moths when we cough or sneeze, and wear a helmet, just to name a few essentials. But for as much emphasis that’s placed on “real world” safety, many people still overlook basic safety practices online.

92% of Americans say they care about online safety, but their actions show otherwise. Like the real parents in the video above, the majority of people use one or a handful of different passwords for all their accounts, and a third have shared their password with others.

Habits like these can make you an easy target for hackers, fraudsters, and data breaches. In 2019 alone, identity fraud losses totaled $16.9 billion. Moreover, it can take anywhere between 100 hours and six months to fix the effects of identity theft. For parents, this can be especially costly. Families with children under 18 are 128% more likely to be victims of identity fraud compared to the average American, and they pay more than twice as much out of pocket as a result of identity fraud.

When Joe Biden won the US Presidential election, President Donald Trump threatened legal action in some of the battleground states that were among the last to count their ballots. It was all part of a campaign to cast doubt on the legality of mail-in ballots, which disproportionately favored Joe Biden. The lawsuits themselves likely won’t alter the course of the election. But one in Pennsylvania sheds light on how the current US Supreme Court might rule on future election laws.

Watch more of our election coverage: http://vox.com/ElectionVideos

The 2020 US election is over, and former vice president Joe Biden will be the 46th US president. He’s the first to defeat an incumbent president in 28 years, and he did it in part by unifying the Democratic Party against Donald Trump, bringing members of the party’s left wing into his campaign after beating Bernie Sanders in the primary, and crafting an aggressive policy platform.

But Biden’s agenda will most likely be met by a Republican-controlled Senate, whose leader, Mitch McConnell, presided over the complete stonewalling of the last Democratic president’s agenda, and likely intends to do so again. This despite the fact that many of Biden’s policies enjoy the support of most Americans, and McConnell’s Senate caucus represents a minority of them.

In other words, Biden’s decisive victory margin of several million votes was basically good enough for a stalemate. In this video, Vox editor-at-large Ezra Klein explains what makes that possible -- a Republican Party dedicated to making sure a minority controls the country -- and how Joe Biden’s first priority should be unwinding that system back to democracy.

In a normal presidential election year, many Americans go from casting our vote before work in the morning to turning off the TV before bed, secure in our knowledge of who will lead the country for the next four years. But in 2020, there’s a better-than-average chance that won’t happen. 

Even before the coronavirus struck, more Americans each election were either voting early or voting my mail. But in 2020, these numbers are expected to skyrocket, and that means states like Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, which don’t start counting mail-in ballots until election day, probably won’t have results for several days. This year, voters are facing a pandemic, a deliberately underfunded postal service, and the closure of polling locations in battleground states like Georgia, Ohio, Arizona, and Texas.

In this video, we take a comprehensive deep dive into how states count votes. Each of the  3,141 counties in the US has its own rules, but there are some basic steps that are mostly the same across the country. Whether you’re voting in person early, on election day, by mail, or dropping off your ballot, we break down some of the differences and similarities in how and when states collect, verify, process, and count ballots.

Once you understand how votes are counted, it’s clear just how important each vote really is.

Watch more 2020 US election coverage at http://vox.com/ElectionVideos

Long before the COVID-19 pandemic hit, low-wage workers in the United States were already struggling to pay their rent, and were being evicted at rates much higher than in other similar countries. In the US, one in 40 renters has been evicted ー compared to one in 89 in the UK, one in 227 in Denmark, and one in 25,000 in France. 

Since the pandemic took millions of US jobs in March and April, most workers who make more than $20 an hour have been able to keep working, or have returned to work. But low wage workers — the people most likely to be renters instead of homeowners — are also the least likely to have gotten their jobs back. Now, seven months into the pandemic, millions aren't working, and many of them are facing homelessness.

In this video we ask what other governments around the world have done to keep people in their homes, what the US has done, what it could do, and if the 2020 election could change any of it.

Watch more of our election coverage: http://vox.com/ElectionVideos

In the 2000 US presidential election, the Democratic candidate got half a million more votes than the Republican. The Democrat lost. Sixteen years later the same thing happened again. In the US, if you run for president, it does not actually matter how many people in the country vote for you. What matters instead is an arcane system for selecting America’s head of state called the Electoral College.

The Electoral College is the reason the US has something called “swing states,” and it’s the reason those places get to decide the future of the country. It’s the reason presidential candidates almost never campaign in the country’s biggest cities. And more recently, it’s also the reason that Republican candidates have been able to eke out victories in the presidential election without actually getting the most votes.

The Electoral College makes some Americans’ votes more powerful than others. In fact, that’s part of the reason we have it to begin with; in the country’s early years, the Electoral College helped give the votes of Southern Whites more weight than the votes of Northerners. The idea at its core, that certain votes simply matter more than others, is baked into the American tradition. In the 2020 election, it may decide the winner.

This reverses Trump's rulings. 

Without federal legislation, the fight against LGBTQ discrimination has been waged in the courts and the White House. 

Watch more 2020 US election explainers at http://vox.com/ElectionVideos.

The US Civil Rights Act of 1964 originally protected against discrimination on the basis of race, color, national origin, and religion. But in a failed political maneuver meant to make the bill so unpopular that it wouldn’t pass, the word “sex” was added as well. That addition protected women from being discriminated against at work, but it also set off a 50-year legal battle over whether the law also protects LGBTQ Americans.

The court has reached a decision in this battle, but the Trump White House has come to a different conclusion. And that means there are huge stakes for LGBTQ rights in the 2020 election.

_7FWr2Nvf9I,Vox,UCLXo7UDZvByw2ixzpQCufnA,The Instagram aesthetic that made QAnon mainstream,2020-10-28 12:00:08+00:00,"Conspiracy theory researchers explain how QAnon spread through Instagram.

Subscribe to our channel! http://goo.gl/0bsAjO

At first glance, the images under the hashtags about child trafficking don’t look that different from anything else you’d expect to see on Instagram. They feature bright pastel colors with trendy fonts spelling out taglines like “wake up” and “get loud.” 

What the people who see these hashtags — and the lifestyle influencers who often post them — might not know is that the hashtag is being used to bring QAnon ideas into the mainstream. In March, 23 percent of people surveyed by Pew had heard of QAnon; by September, that number had risen to 47 percent. Now the conspiracy theory has reached a bigger support base than ever before via QAnon-lite memes — with serious implications for the election.

8yNkBic7GfI,Vox,UCLXo7UDZvByw2ixzpQCufnA,The technology that’s replacing the green screen,2020-10-23 12:00:06+00:00,"The green screen is a Hollywood staple. Should it be?

It’s easy to complain about overreliance on special effects, but for projects that require impossible-to-film environments or have incredibly expensive shots, how do you get the flexibility of green screens without the drawbacks?

Charmaine Chan has worked on one of the possible answers. Vox's Phil Edwards spoke to her about her career and how it's at the forefront of a big technological shift. As a compositor for venerable effects house Industrial Light and Magic (ILM), she’s worked on films like The Last Jedi, assembling various digital elements into a beautiful, seamless image. Her job changed on The Mandalorian, one of the first shows to use ILM’s upgrade for the green screen: LED panels that used video game engine technology to place a realistic-looking world behind the actors.

It was a huge improvement, because green screens actually have a lot of drawbacks. Removing the green screen is never as quick as visual effects artists would hope. It also casts green light upon the set and actors. Even substitutes for a green screen, like projecting an image onto a screen behind the actor, fail to dynamically respond to camera movements the way they would in the real world.

ILM’s solution fixes a lot of those problems, and it also led to creative breakthroughs in which the old Hollywood order of a TV show or movie, in which VFX came last, was suddenly reversed. Now, artists like Charmaine are alongside actors, set designers, and other crew members during filming. That collaboration means that this technology doesn’t just eliminate a screen — it eliminates a creative barrier.

Watch the above video to see how it happens.

We produced this video in 2020 as part of our US election coverage. The rest of those videos are at http://vox.com/ElectionVideos

In the middle of the 20th century, the US government made a decision that would transform American cities: It built a huge system of interstate highways, many of which went right through the downtowns of its biggest cities.

This sealed the country's fate as a car culture, and today we're seeing the results. In most cities, it's extremely difficult to get around without a car, in part due to public transit systems built to serve an outdated commute. And when our politics turn to infrastructure, the government often favors building new roads and highways instead of improving and expanding public transportation.

The result is a system that forces more Americans to drive, at the expense of those who rely on public transit. It's also the biggest contributor to our country’s carbon footprint. Fixing that over the long term will require a reimagining of American cities and towns. But there's also a way that, if we wanted to, we could improve American transit systems, and get more people riding them, in a matter of weeks.

Watch more 2020 US election explainers at http://vox.com/ElectionVideos

For 150 years, the US avoided formal alliances. It occasionally went to war -- fighting the War of 1812, the Spanish-American War, and World War I -- but did so without entangling itself in promises to other countries. Then, after World War II, it abruptly changed course, and began to build a network of alliances unlike anything that had come before.

Over the next few decades, the US used those alliances to keep countries around the world close, and to fight Soviet expansion, by making a promise that it would go to war if any of its allies were ever attacked. After the Soviet Union fell, the initial purpose of those alliances was gone, but the US recommitted to them, signaling again and again that the central promise of those relationships was still in effect. It kept doing so for the next 25 years.

Then the US elected a leader who took America’s global relationships in a new direction. President Trump was skeptical that America’s network of alliances was still beneficial to the US. He began to distance the US from those alliances, raising doubts about whether America would actually follow through on the promise at the core of them if provoked. Some allies moved closer to Russia or China, both of whom had attempted to undermine America’s alliances.

Today, the future of those alliances is on the ballot in the US. One of the major presidential candidates in the 2020 election wants to return the US to its former status with its allies; the other finds its decades-old alliances costly and cumbersome. The world is waiting to see which vision Americans prefer.

Watch more 2020 US election explainers at http://vox.com/ElectionVideos

Police reform is a major issue in the 2020 election, yet it’s also one of the issues the president has little control over. Police are primarily funded and managed by local governments instead of the federal government. So when it comes to what the president or Congress can actually do to change policing in America…it’s pretty limited. 

But the federal government does have the power to change what's called qualified immunity. It’s a legal protection that shields police from lawsuits over violations of people’s constitutional rights. For protesters of police brutality, reforming it is at the top of their list. And its future could hang on the election.

Giralt began his career as a stills photographer, but he saw potential for more thanks to his hobbies in engineering. A new discipline was born: visual engineering, using robotics, advanced camerawork, and a lot of creativity to create moving images that have never been seen before. His Smores have lit up Times Square, and, in the video above, you can watch how he uses trial and error (and more than a few robots) to drop the perfect lime.

Giralt’s toolkit includes Arduino programming, Maya, welding, epoxies, super-expensive cameras that can shoot incredible slow motion, and a lot of elbow grease and ingenuity. This form of commercial art shows how technology can make incredible images happen — and you don’t always need computer graphics to do it.

As World War Two was ending, the growing nuclear arms race put the US in need of uranium. It turned to Navajo Nation, where the uranium mining industry thrived for four decades --  but left disease, pollution and the biggest radioactive spill in US history. 

That spill in Church Rock, New Mexico upended the lives of nearby residents, who had to grapple with toxic water, livestock and a lifetime of illnesses. Now, they are still waiting for it to be cleaned up.

Watch more 2020 US election explainers at http://vox.com/ElectionVideos

When it comes to who gets punished and removed from American classrooms, the US doesn’t treat all students equally. Black students get suspended and expelled far more frequently than their white classmates, and often for the same or similar offenses. And the weeks of school that Black kids miss each year can kick off a chain reaction that changes a child’s future.

But the US education system gives the American president a tremendous amount of power over public schools. Whoever holds the Presidency decides how schools handle things like testing, class size, and discipline. 

During the Obama administration, the US Department of Education started to take the country’s school discipline problem seriously. They investigated the schools with significant racial gaps in punishment rates, and issued guidance on how to replace outdated policies with more effective ones.

Then Betsy DeVos, President Trump’s education secretary, abandoned those efforts. Trump's administration stopped releasing discipline data, changed the standard of what constitutes racist outcomes, and scaled back efforts to fix or even acknowledge racial disparities in how we punish kids. In this video we explain the origins of this crisis, and how the 2020 election could change things.

Become a Video Lab member! http://bit.ly/video-lab

For over 200 years, Japan isolated itself from the outside world by forbidding most foreigners from entering the country. But in 1854, a US naval expedition of warships forced Japan to open its port cities, resulting in a flood of curious travelers from Europe and North America, who established businesses there. Photography became a leading industry in newly opened Japan, to satisfy a market of curious outsiders who wanted to know what the country and its people really looked like. 

Foreign photographers like Felice Beato and Baron Raimund von Stillfried established photo studios, and they employed fine artists from the Japanese ukiyo-e woodblock print industry to carefully apply watercolors to their prints. Eventually, those same apprentices dominated the market with their own photo studios. 

By the 20th century, mainly due to the advent of amateur photography, the souvenir photo industry in Japan declined. But for the last half of the 19th century, photos made — and carefully hand-colored — in Japanese photo studios were important documents for how the world came to know Japanese culture.

Listen to the story on this episode of Today, Explained: https://spoti.fi/2GuKqLz 

When we think of the iconic moments of the Civil Rights Movement in the US, we might imagine bus boycotts, lunch counter sit-ins or the March on Washington. Most of us won’t think of protests at beaches and pools. Yet these battles in the country’s waters played a crucial role in transforming America. 

The campaign in the waters of St. Augustine, Florida, became one of the most critical in the movement to desegregate the US. The photos were published around the world, but the full story has often been left out of our history textbooks. And now, the legacy of segregated public waters continues to this day.

According to a report by CNN, the federal government has warned that Russia ""might seek to covertly discourage or suppress US voters from participating"" in the upcoming election. If so, it would be a repeat of their tactics four years ago, when Russian operatives posing as Americans on social media discouraged Black Americans from voting or encouraged them to vote for the third-party candidate, Jill Stein. The Trump campaign itself pursued a strategy of vote suppression targeted at African Americans, who vote against Republicans at higher rates than any other demographic group. 

While voter suppression takes many forms — from intimidation at polling places to purges of voter rolls to strict ID requirements — this video focuses on digital voter suppression, where the goal is to infiltrate communities online and deliver covert messages that discourage participation in elections. We explain what those messages look like, and why they so often target Black voters.

Watch more 2020 election explainers at http://vox.com/ElectionVideos 

For the past 44 years, every US Congress and president have approved a federal budget that includes a ban on federal funding for abortion services, except in extreme cases. It's known as the Hyde Amendment, and even politicians who support abortion access have voted in favor of it. But the landscape of abortion access has evolved so much that Joe Biden might become the first president to lift the Hyde Amendment from the federal budget. 

Banning federal funding for abortion services primarily affects people who rely on Medicaid for their health care: people who are living close to the poverty line in the US or are disabled. This has the effect of preventing some of the country’s most vulnerable people from accessing abortion services, since they are the least likely to be able to afford an out-of-pocket expense.

Subscribe to our channel! http://goo.gl/0bsAjO

Brazil imported more African slaves than any other country in the world: over 4 million people. Despite the ancestry forming a big part of the population, the development of a national Black identity was hindered after the country’s abolition of slavery in 1888.

Brazil didn’t have an apartheid system like South Africa’s or Jim Crow laws like the United States, and its mixed population was seen as a symbol of harmony between races. The idea of Brazil being a “racial democracy” affected how Brazilians saw the role of race in their own lives — until the myth was debunked.

“Several people were raised with certain privileges for being a light-skinned person, but still suffering some discrimination and not understanding exactly why is that so,” explains lawyer and diversity studies professor Thiago Amparo. “Only by understanding the history of Brazil, the [social] construction of whiteness and their own Black ancestry, they start to self-identify as Black.”
The rise in the number of Brazilians who self-identify as Black came as a result of the Black movement’s fight to denounce racism in the country and to promote positive references of Blackness. Many achievements have been made over the past decades, such as the implementation of affirmative action practices. However, challenges remain. Seventy-five percent of people killed by police in Brazil in 2019 were Black, and socio-economic characteristics of this population widely differ from those of white people.

Subscribe to our channel! http://goo.gl/0bsAjO

On August 4, 2020, a massive explosion rocked Beirut, the capital city of Lebanon. The blast occurred when sparks in a warehouse hit a stockpile of ammonium nitrate — a highly explosive material — that was stored in the city's port. It was one of the largest accidental explosions in history and it couldn't have occurred at a worse time for Lebanon. 

For the past several years, the country has been sliding into an economic depression and a political crisis. The root causes began during the country's 20-year civil war and extend to the organization of the government, in which control is divided among the country's many religious sects.

After years of corruption and negligence, Lebanon's people are now stuck picking up the pieces.

Watch more 2020 election explainers at http://vox.com/ElectionVideos 

The process of voting isn’t the same for all Americans. Depending on where you live, you might vote on a screen, a punchcard, or a piece of paper. You might have to show an ID to vote, or you might not. And you might have to wait a long time, or you might not.

Some of these differences don’t really matter. But some of them make voting harder. And sometimes they can keep people from voting altogether. For decades, the US had a civil rights law that made sure those differences were fair, and didn’t disproportionately keep certain people from voting: the 1965 Voting Rights Act. But in 2013, the US Supreme Court gutted that law, allowing states to pass a slew of new voting laws.

Those new laws often had the effect of making it harder for poor people and people of color to vote. And the 2020 US election will be shaped in part by those laws. But the same election will also decide the future of those laws.

Danielle Gervais is the Emmy-winning casting director for Netflix’s Queer Eye (and she and her team are nominated this year as well). In addition to the hit series, she’s cast everything from Pawn Stars to Wife Swap.

Vox’s Phil Edwards spoke to her about what it takes to find the right people at the center of each episode: the “heroes” that the show’s core cast give a makeover (or, in Danielle’s words, a “make better”). 

It’s not just her and her team sitting in an audition room. After hashing out story themes and location for the new season, they’ll hit the ground in their new setting (in normal circumstances) and try to find the perfect people to feature on the show. Extensive interviews and background checks help finish the project — and the result of all that hard work is an hour of seamless entertainment, with a perfect star at the center.

QfAXbGInwno,Vox,UCLXo7UDZvByw2ixzpQCufnA,"How America can leave fossil fuels behind, in one chart | 2020 Election",2020-09-10 12:00:06+00:00,"And what the US election means for climate change.

Watch more 2020 election explainers at http://vox.com/ElectionVideos 

All of recorded human history has happened during a period in which the average global temperature didn’t change by more than 1 degree Celsius. But the burning of fossil fuels has triggered a temperature rise projected to exceed 3 degrees by the end of the century. It will be catastrophic. But it can be avoided if we massively scale back the burning of fossil fuels.

The US isn’t the biggest emitter of carbon dioxide in the world, but it's emitted more carbon dioxide in total than any other country. So the US has an important role to play in global decarbonization; the world basically can’t get there without the US’s full participation. But the current US president doesn’t have any plans to do that. His Democratic challenger in the 2020 election, Joe Biden, does.

Biden’s plan is ambitious: Its goal is to completely transition the US to clean energy by 2050. But his plan doesn’t get into the details of exactly how that will happen. For that, we talked to physicist and engineer Saul Griffith, who took us through his incredibly detailed road map for how the US could actually walk away from fossil fuels in the next 30 years.

Subscribe to our channel! http://goo.gl/0bsAjO

There used to be this thing called a party. The concept was simple — gather a bunch of living, breathing bodies in the same place at the same time and just see what happens. And if my friends wanted me to be on time to a party, they’d lie.

I wasn’t proud of my reputation with time. Once, someone was describing their color blindness to me and it reminded me a lot of how I feel about time. How I know that 3 pm and 3:05 pm are technically different, but I personally don’t perceive that contrast.

I tried my best to banish those thoughts. I bought clocks and set them to five minutes early. And I was finally closing the gap — becoming one of those people who holds the reins of time. And then — the pandemic happened.

And suddenly Tuesdays were Thursdays were Sundays. The whole world joined me in temporal disorientation — even my punctual superiors were at a loss. They knew how to arrive five minutes early — not how to repeat the same five minutes 43,854 times.

Maybe we’ve all been too fixated on keeping track of time when what we need most is vocabulary to describe the new colors of time.

_cj_8_upaVo,Vox,UCLXo7UDZvByw2ixzpQCufnA,How to be a cloud detective,2020-09-04 12:00:10+00:00,"What different clouds mean, explained for kids.

Welcome to our first-ever week of programming for kids! 

If you’re standing outside and you look up, you’ll likely see something familiar above you: clouds! They can be long and skinny, low and rumbly, white and fluffy, or anything in between. But what do these different shapes and colors tell us?

Every cloud is packed full of information, and knowing a bit about them can help you tell the difference between different types — and help you predict the weather. 

For example, cumulus clouds are pretty easy to spot. They’re the classic cloud shape: big, fluffy, white cotton balls in the sky. These usually mean fair weather; when you see them, it’s a good day to be outside. 

If you see a big blanket of clouds covering the sky, they might be altostratus — and they might mean that rain is coming. 

Dr. Mayra Oyola from NASA’s jet propulsion lab helped me identify these and other clouds, both common and uncommon. She shared some tips for how we can all get better at decoding clouds. 

To download and print out your own cloud chart, like the one we showed in this video, get permission from your guardian or parent or have them click this link: http://vox.com/clouds

Welcome to our first-ever week of programming for kids! 

Earlier this year I noticed a bird nest with a single bright blue egg sitting on my front porch. Over the course of a few days, the single egg turned into four, and in a few more days, they hatched. What I witnessed over the course of watching these birds grow was magical, but it also left me with a lot of questions about what goes on in the beginning of a bird's life. 

My biggest question: Where does all the bird poop go? 

To answer all of my question about these baby birds, I spoke with professor of biology and lifelong bird lover Michael Murphy about the weird and often gross things birds do to survive.

Welcome to our first-ever week of programming for kids! 

We wanted to launch some marshmallows, so we built a miniature machine based on Leonardo da Vinci’s designs.

Leonardo da Vinci was a famous artist and inventor, and his sketchbooks include a couple of catapult drawings that you can use to make a catapult model. We did just that, and it was a lot of fun.

Catapults have a long history, going back to the ancient world (and appearing all across it, from China to Rome). They were used throughout history to bombard castle walls and enemies with projectiles, and they were adapted in the Middle Ages into agents of biological warfare. There are different types, like a mangonel, a trebuchet, and a ballista, each of which has its own unique advantages.

Our catapult is inspired by da Vinci’s, and it features some really creative ways to generate and store power. We hope you like it — and maybe you’ll try it yourself!

Welcome to our first-ever week of programming for kids! 

The killings of George Floyd, Breonna Taylor, and hundreds of other Black Americans at the hands of police officers have inspired protests across the country and around the world.

The news coverage has been impossible for most of us to ignore, and it begs the question: How are kids, especially Black kids, processing this reality? How do they make sense of these deaths and the systemic factors that made them possible?  

In June of 2020,11-year-old Californian Jolia Bossette decided to use her fifth-grade graduation speech as an occasion to give voice to her thoughts and feelings. In her speech, she reminisced about how she was ""the cutest thing,"" as a toddler and asked, ""But when did I stop being cute and start being scary?""

""Does my dad scare you? Does my mom scare you? Does my auntie scare you? Because let me tell you something: We are not scary.""

Join the Open Sourced Reporting Network: http://www.vox.com/opensourcednetwork

On August 6, President Trump issued an executive order prohibiting transactions with the video-sharing app TikTok. His order said that because TikTok is owned by the Beijing-based company ByteDance, the app could pose national security and privacy risks to users in the US.

But the Trump administration’s targeting of TikTok marks a departure from America’s traditional position on internet governance and online free speech. And it also comes at a time when the concept of a global internet itself is under threat. 

Today a growing number of countries are pursuing various forms of internet sovereignty — from Russia building a walled-off “intranet,” to India regularly shutting down its internet in areas of social unrest, to some European nations introducing a “right to be forgotten” from search engines. 

All these trends point in the direction of a “splinternet,” where your experience of the internet increasingly depends on where you live, and the whims of the ruling parties there. As we explain in this video, that’s a tough environment for an app like TikTok, which became globally successful almost immediately, and which connects people from around the world in hyper-personalized but often international subcultures. 

With the excesses of the open internet visible daily (see: foreign election interference, data breaches, misinformation and hate speech, and domestic and corporate surveillance), the countries that do support a free internet will have to work hard to secure its future. But they may have to do it without the United States.

On this landmark 100th anniversary of women’s suffrage, historians Martha S. Jones and Daina Ramey Berry reflect on what the 19th Amendment means for Black American women. The women’s suffrage movement was a predominantly white cause, one that sacrificed the involvement of Black suffragists in return for support for the 19th Amendment from Southern states. 

The 1920 legislation enfranchised all American women, but it left Black women, particularly those living in the South, to fight racial discrimination when registering to vote and going to the polls. It wasn’t until the Voting Rights Act of 1965 that this type of racial discrimination was prohibited by federal law. 

The voting rights fight is still not over, however. There’s evidence that restrictions to voting disproportionately affect minority populations — measures like voter ID laws, voting purges, gerrymandering, and closing polling locations. 

The headline to this video has been changed. Previously it was titled: The myth of the 19th amendment

Subscribe to our channel! http://goo.gl/0bsAjO

The message from public health experts is clear: Wearing a mask can help stop the spread of coronavirus. But that message hasn't completely gotten through; many Americans still simply don't believe it. It's a major failure of communication, one that has almost certainly cost lives.

But the US government actually had a plan to prevent almost this exact situation from happening: A written set of rules to communicating in a public health crisis, including how to make sure that public health information doesn't get mixed up with politics. But then, when the biggest health crisis in a century arrived, they ignored it completely.

In the last half-century, the global production of meat has undergone a seismic shift. While meat was once mostly raised on small farms, today almost all the meat we eat comes from industrialized “factory” farms, known as “concentrated animal feeding operations,” or CAFOs. Animals in CAFOs are often packed closely together, which makes them both efficient and, for many, ethically dubious. But infectious disease experts worry about CAFOs for a different reason: Because they’re also an ideal environment for virus and bacteria mutations that human immune systems have never seen. In other words, they’re a highly likely source for the next pandemic.

The US has a huge election coming up, but to explain it, we want your help. Instead of deciding on our own what the most important issues are, we want to know what you think is important. What do you wish the candidates in the 2020 US election would talk about?

Once we’ve heard from you, we’ll update our Community tab with the list of the ideas that we’re turning into videos, so you’ll know what’s in the works. Starting in September, we’ll publish one video from that list every week.

A lot of news coverage of elections focuses on the polls, or the candidates’ personalities, or predictions about who might win. With this project, we want to do something different, and focus instead on how your lives might be affected by the election’s outcome. So tell us what you think the candidates in the US election should be talking about. And thanks for watching.

Become a Video Lab member! http://bit.ly/video-lab

With thousands of people dying of Covid-19 every day, the sooner a vaccine can be deemed safe and effective, the better. But vaccine development is a lengthy process that isn’t easy to rush, and that’s in part because of the final step in testing any vaccine: the phase III trial. Phase III requires tens of thousands of volunteers, each of whom get either a placebo or an experimental vaccine. The problem is the next part: Vaccine developers have to wait until a statistically significant number of them, going about their lives normally, eventually get naturally infected. This can take years.

To speed that up, some epidemiologists and scientists are calling for something called a human challenge trial, in which a subject who has been given the vaccine is deliberately infected. This isn’t a new concept; human challenge trials have been used to develop vaccines or treatments for lots of diseases, like cholera, typhoid, malaria, influenza, and common cold viruses. But what sets Covid-19 apart from those diseases is that it currently has no effective treatment. Because it’s so new, we also aren’t fully aware of its long-term health effects. Unlike other human challenge trials, a Covid-19 challenge trial would entail a risk of serious illness — and even death.

It’s because of those risks that a Covid-19 challenge trial would be limited to the young and healthy, who would be at the lowest risk of harm. But there are questions beyond the ethics. Would artificially infecting someone in a lab setting provide useful information on how to prevent natural infection? Would a study performed on only young and healthy people produce a vaccine that works for everyone? And with some vaccines already far along in their phase III trials, would a human challenge trial do any good at this point? 

Even though no Covid-19 human challenge trials are currently planned, more than 30,000 people from nearly 150 countries have already said they would volunteer for one if the opportunity presented itself. The question is, should we let them?

Note: The headline on this piece has been updated.

Coffee is one of the most popular commodities on Earth. It's grown by nearly 125 million farmers, from Latin America to Africa to Asia. But as man-made climate change warms the atmosphere, the notoriously particular coffee plant is struggling. Places like Colombia, which once had the perfect climate to grow Arabica coffee, are changing. Now, experts estimate the amount of land that can sustain coffee will fall 50 percent by 2050. It's not just a crisis for consumers but for the millions who have made a livelihood out of growing coffee.

Some of the world’s greatest cultural and historical treasures are housed in London’s British Museum, and a significant number of them were taken during Britain’s centuries-long imperial rule. In recent years, many of the countries missing their cultural heritage have been asking for some of these items back. 

Benin City in Nigeria is one of those places. They've been calling for the return of the Benin Bronzes, hundreds of artifacts looted in 1897 when British soldiers embarked a punitive expedition to Benin. Many are now housed in the British Museum. 

And it's just the beginning. As the world reckons with the damage inflicted during Europe’s colonial global takeover, the calls for these items to be returned are getting louder and louder.

North Carolina’s Cape Fear River is a massive water system. It stretches across the lower half of the state, collecting runoff from 29 counties and providing water to millions of people. But in the city of Wilmington, where the river meets the Atlantic Ocean, the water has residents worried. 

In a 2019 test of tap water, Wilmington and neighboring Brunswick county were among the top five areas for high levels of PFAS, or per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances — a group of man-made chemicals commonly used for making nonstick or water-resistant products. Now North Carolina is reckoning with the legacy of pollution upstream — and discovering what decades of PFAS contamination means for the rest of the country.

In 2019, Facebook settled a lawsuit with civil rights groups following the revelation that advertisers using their platform could use the targeting options to exclude many specific demographics from seeing their ads. It's now more difficult for an unscrupulous advertiser to use Facebook's platform to discriminate. 

However, even when you remove human bias from the system, Facebook's ad delivery algorithms can result in biased outcomes. According to research from Northeastern University, Facebook sometimes displays ads to highly skewed audiences based on the content of the ad. 

By purchasing ads and inputting neutral targeting options, the researchers found that the algorithmically determined audience for job ads for cleaners, secretaries, nurses, and preschool teachers was mostly women. The job ads for fast food workers, supermarket cashiers, and taxi drivers skewed toward Black users. The studies show that by targeting ""relevant"" users, these systems can reinforce existing disparities in our interests and our opportunities.

Become a Video Lab member! http://bit.ly/video-lab

British suffragettes in the early 20th century used spectacle and drama to draw attention to their fight to win women the vote. They delivered public speeches, marched, displayed colorful banners, and got thrown in jail, all in an effort to pressure legislators to extend suffrage to women. 

But after a violent clash with police in November 1910 — a day known as “Black Friday” — their tactics changed. They began committing random acts of property damage: smashing windows, setting fire to buildings, even destroying fine art on public display. 

The most radical act of destruction came in 1913, when militant suffragette Emily Wilding Davison threw herself under King George V’s racehorse at a major public event. She died of her injuries and became a suffragette martyr. 

Ultimately, her funeral procession ended up being one of the largest, and last, major demonstrations by the militant suffragettes. World War I interrupted their protests, and women over 30 won the vote in 1918, when the war ended.

v3MtBE37wHY,Vox,UCLXo7UDZvByw2ixzpQCufnA,How slow motion works,2020-07-23 16:00:30+00:00,"This video is sponsored by Raycon. To get 15% off, click here: http://buyraycon.com/vox 
Slow motion is a key part of modern visual culture, from iPhone selfies to movies. So how does it work?

Subscribe to our channel! http://goo.gl/0bsAjO

In this episode of Vox Almanac, Vox’s Phil Edwards explores how slow motion works and how it became a part of movie history. It’s a history that starts at the very beginning of photography, when pioneers like Étienne-Jules Marey and Eadweard Muybridge discovered that capturing images required capturing motion, too.

Slow motion was key in the silent film days, in which camera operators would overcrank their cameras (slowing down footage) or undercrank (speeding it up). These experiments could range from goofy to dreamy. Soon after the addition of sound, Hollywood embraced a standard speed for movies — and slow motion became an even more important tool.

As the video shows, it showed up in sports reels, movie musicals, and artsy French dramas. And before long, it was part of the action movie landscape too, from Seven Samurai to Bonnie and Clyde.

Today, we take for granted that slow motion is one of the available tools to moviemakers, whether they’re working on an iPhone or a Hollywood set. And it probably won’t stop anytime soon.

Subscribe to our channel! http://goo.gl/0bsAjO

On June 26, 2020, the US House of Representatives voted to make America’s capital city, Washington, DC, the country’s 51st state. It was a historic vote, and the closest the country has come to adding a new state in over 60 years. But it was also, for the time being, completely symbolic. Because at least in 2020, DC has no chance of actually becoming a state.

That June 26 vote was almost entirely along party lines; Democrats mostly voted in favor of DC statehood, and Republicans against it. That’s because making DC a state would give the Democrats additional seats in Congress, potentially affecting the balance of power between the parties. It’s why President Trump and the Republican-controlled Senate have both promised to strike down any bid for DC statehood. And in fact, statehood in the US has always been a political issue. In the past, the US has often added states in pairs to preserve the political balance. Admitting a new state on its own has happened, but it’s unusual.

But the case for DC statehood is strong: The city has a similar population to several states, its hundreds of thousands of residents lack any say in national lawmaking, and its local government is uniquely vulnerable to being strong-armed by Congress and the federal government. Simply put, the laws that created the district did not anticipate that it would one day be a major city. And while in 1993, the last time Congress voted on DC statehood, the Democratic-controlled House failed to pass it, today’s Democratic Party is increasingly on board with it. If 2020’s election puts the Democrats in full control of the federal government, America might actually get its 51st state.

Man-made climate change is warming the planet's atmosphere and oceans, and the effects are being felt the most at the poles. In Antarctica, home to the largest chunk of ice on earth, ice shelves and glaciers are beginning to collapse, and one in particular could spell disaster. The Thwaites Glacier, in West Antarctica, has retreated more than 14 kilometers in the last two decades as warm ocean water undermines it. The glacier is situated on a downward slope that falls deep into the center of Antarctica. It's why scientists are racing to find out how close it is to total collapse - and what that would mean for future sea levels.

Become a Video Lab member! http://bit.ly/video-lab

The image of sprinters Tommie Smith and John Carlos raising their fists during a medal ceremony at the 1968 Olympics in Mexico City is an enduring image of silent protest. But the key to understanding it goes beyond the black-gloved fists. All three medal winners, including silver medalist Peter Norman of Australia, wore buttons that read “Olympic Project for Human Rights.” The Olympic Project for Human Rights (OPHR) was a coalition of prominent athletes formed in 1967 that threatened to boycott participating in the upcoming Olympic games, in order to draw attention to systemic racism in the United States. The group, led by professor Harry Edwards, ultimately voted to compete in the games and hold their demonstrations there, which led to the now-iconic display on the medal stand following the men’s 200-meter final. This act got Smith and Carlos kicked off the team, but left a lasting legacy on making political statements through sport.

Become a Video Lab member! http://bit.ly/video-lab

Over the last 40 years, disease outbreaks among humans have become more and more frequent. The majority of those diseases are zoonoses, or diseases that originated in animals, like Ebola, West Nile virus, and probably Covid-19. But what makes zoonotic outbreaks likelier than ever is actually something humans are doing.

According to science journalist Sonia Shah, author of the 2017 book ""Pandemic,"" the expansion of humans onto more and more of the planet’s land has increased the likelihood of disease outbreaks in two ways. First, as humans move into what were once animal habitats, we end up living closer to animals that might contain dangerous pathogens; and second, as we destroy or alter animal habitats, we’re driving away or killing off animals that once served as a “firewall” between those pathogens and us. And the human land development driving this trend shows no signs of stopping.

Correction: At 4:28 and 4:49 we mistakenly depict the European robin. The species actually responsible for the spread of West Nile virus in North America is the American robin.

On May 25, 2020, Minneapolis police officers killed an unarmed black man named George Floyd. After video of Floyd’s death spread on the internet, protesters filled the streets across the US, demanding an end to police brutality and a reckoning with the unequal treatment of Black Americans, but also with another, more direct demand: That his killers be punished.
 
Until recent years, there was no reliable data on how many people in the US were killed by police every year, or on the legal outcomes of those killings. But data collected by the Mapping Police Violence project provides some answers, including one that has held steady every year for which we have data: Police are almost never charged with killing someone, and are even less often convicted.
 
The data shows that less than 3% of police killings lead to the officer being charged with a crime, and fewer than 1% of them result in a conviction, and that these rates are the same regardless of the victim’s race. But it also shows that a Black American is three times more likely to be killed by police than a white American.
 
Here’s Mapping Police Violence’s data, which we rely on throughout the video: 
https://mappingpoliceviolence.org/
 
The Washington Post also keeps a record of deaths caused by police shootings, which had similar findings:

Become a Video Lab member! http://bit.ly/video-lab

Filipino nurses have been disproportionately affected by the coronavirus in the US. That’s because they make up an outsized portion of the nursing workforce. About one-third of all foreign-born nurses in the US are Filipino. 

Since 1960, 150,000 Filipino nurses have come to work in the US. And that’s because over the past century the US built a pipeline that draws nurses from the Philippines every time it faces a shortage. This system began in the early 20th century when the US invaded and colonized the Philippines and lives on through today. 

To understand the long history behind the large presence of Filipino nurses in the US and how and why it continues to this very day,  watch the video above. And let us know what you think in the comments!

Subscribe to our channel! http://goo.gl/0bsAjO

Among those protesting police brutality in the US, there is a slogan that’s taken hold: “defund the police.” The key idea is a push to move the billions of dollars we spend on police in the US, to social services and other public spending. The disparities between policing budgets and those of other city agencies are massive. And while defunding the police might sound radical, it’s a policy activists have been talking about for decades. For some, it can mean reforms that simply lessen the police role in society, while for others — the slogan is a call to abolish the system and create something new entirely. 

These ideas have all converged into the popular “defund the police” slogan, and the renewed energy around the movement is working.

Subscribe to our channel! http://goo.gl/0bsAjO

Across the country, Americans protesting racial injustice and police brutality – the overwhelming majority of them peacefully – have been met by police forces that look more like an army. Officers have shown up to protests with riot gear, armored trucks, and military rifles. This is what America’s police now look like, and it’s the result of a decades-long buildup of military equipment among the country’s police departments. It began as a Reagan-era program to give police departments more resources to fight the War on Drugs, and has escalated ever since. Today, the idea of a militarized police force is baked into how American police see themselves.

In a region where food is already scarce, billions of insects are now eating everything in sight.

Since late 2019, East Africa and the Middle East have been experiencing their worst locust outbreaks in decades. A small locust swarm can eat more food than 35,000 people; but some locust swarms in the area have grown to over two thousand times that size. And it’s all coming right on the heels of a season of catastrophic flooding in the region.

But that isn’t a coincidence: The desert locust thrives when dry weather turns wet. And in 2018 and 2019, a series of freak weather events brought record-setting rainfall to the Middle East and East Africa. The result of all this is a region at risk of a famine, in the middle of a pandemic. And because freak weather is a hallmark of climate change, it’s also the kind of thing we can expect to happen again.

Note: This video was previously titled, ""Juneteenth, explained."" The title has been changed to better reflect the video's content. 

When American schoolchildren learn about chattel slavery in the US, we’re often told it ended with Abraham Lincoln’s signature on the Emancipation Proclamation of 1863. 

But, as late as June 19, 1865, enslaved people in Texas were still held in bondage. On that date, the Federal troops entered the state and began to punish slave holders and former confederates who refused to obey the law. 

“Juneteenth is a deeply emotional moment for enslaved people,” says historian Karlos K. Hill, of the University of Oklahoma. 

In Texas and across the country, emancipated African Americans began celebrating annually, with parades, concerts, and picnics. “Being able to go wherever they want and being able to wander about; for enslaved people, it was an expression of their freedom,” says Hill. “Formerly enslaved people celebrating, in public, their newfound freedom, was an act of resistance.”

However, by 1877, the Federal government had largely abandoned the South. The lynching era— when hundreds of African Americans were killed by white mobs each year across the North and the South— began soon after. 

Today, Dr. Hill says, commemorating Juneteenth is important for all Americans because it helps us see all the ways that slavery still shapes this country, including, as he says, “the desire to master and dominate black bodies.”

Coronavirus continues to infect nearly every aspect of American life — on US farms, it’s led to the widespread destruction of fresh food. Take milk, for example. Dairy farmers across the country have dumped millions of gallons of fresh milk. This, at a time when millions of Americans are dealing with food insecurity. Since so many schools and businesses are now closed, dairy farmers have nowhere to direct those products. Check out the video above to learn more about this break in the food supply chain, and why it’s not easy to redirect supply that was going to schools and businesses to consumers or food banks instead.

As coronavirus lockdowns loosen, flights are starting to fill up — leading many people to call for empty middle seats. Keeping middle seats open on a plane can help maintain physical distance between passengers. But it’s unlikely to prevent virus transmission; there are many other ways coronavirus can spread on an airplane. One thing’s for sure, though: a vacant middle seat will definitely affect how much we pay to fly.

Subscribe to our channel! http://goo.gl/0bsAjO

In this episode of Vox Almanac, Vox’s Phil Edwards explores Dr. John Snow’s map of the Broad Street Pump, which changed epidemiology forever.

In 1854, news spread about a mysterious new cholera outbreak in London. At the time, doctors and scientists largely believed the disease traveled in a “miasma” — a floating cloud of sickness. Dr. John Snow suspected bad water might actually be the agent of transmission — and he wanted to prove it in time to stop the outbreak.

Through a mix of personal interviews, clever detective work, and data analysis that included tables and a famous map, Snow managed to stop the outbreak and convince local public health officials, eventually, that cholera could be transmitted through water, not a miasma. Since his breakthrough study, the map has become an iconic piece of epidemiological history, as an illustration of keen detective work, analysis, and visual representation with a map that, even today, tells a story.

Millions of Americans across the country have lost their jobs. But whether or not those people can get the unemployment benefits they deserve actually depends on where they live. In some states, more than two thirds of jobless people typically collect unemployment benefits. But in others, like Florida, fewer than one in 10 unemployed people get those benefits.

That massive difference has often been blamed on technology; Florida’s unemployment system is notoriously difficult to use. But technology doesn’t build itself. The real explanation requires a look at the ideology of the people who did.

Albert Einstein’s theory of general relativity, published in 1915, defined gravity as the influence of massive objects, like planets and stars, curving space around them. This was very different from the way Isaac Newton had defined gravity over 200 years earlier: Newton described an attracting force that kept planets and stars in orbit with each other. If Einstein was right, then light would also bend near massive objects. And in 1919, two British expeditions set out to test it by photographing a total solar eclipse. By comparing the position of stars with the sun in front of them and another with the sun elsewhere, Arthur Eddington and his team proved that the stars’ apparent positions moved during the eclipse. This was the first, but not the last time Einstein’s theory of general relativity was tested and proven, and Einstein became a celebrity overnight. He remained a pop culture icon for the rest of his life.

Actress Kristen Bell first found out there were deepfake porn videos of her online from her husband, actor Dax Shepherd. In the videos, her face has been manipulated onto porn stars’ bodies.

“I was just shocked,” the actress told Vox. “It's hard to think about that I'm being exploited.”

And this isn’t only happening to celebrities. Noelle Martin, a recent law graduate in Perth, Australia, discovered that someone took photos she’d shared on social media and used them first to photoshop her face into nude images, and then to create deepfake videos.

Deepfakes are often portrayed as a political threat — fake videos of politicians making comments they never made. But in a recent report, the research group Deeptrace found that 96% of deepfakes found online are pornographic. Of those videos, virtually all are of women. And virtually all are made without their consent.

Become a Video Lab member! http://bit.ly/video-lab

The killings of George Floyd, Breonna Taylor, and Ahmaud Arbery have ignited protests around the world. Those protests have dominated news coverage. But when it comes to communicating the protests’ scale, character, and purpose, a lot of that coverage falls short.

Part of that is because of the media’s incentive to highlight the most dramatic imagery; it’s why so much protest coverage has been filled with violent and chaotic scenes of fire, looters, and tear gas. But it’s also because of the nature of protest imagery itself. In this video, journalism professor Jason Johnson and Vox editor Kainaz Amaria explain that, while the news can show you what a protest looks like, it’s a lot worse at telling you why it’s happening.

There are two ways you could assess the deadliness of a crisis like the novel coronavirus pandemic. One is to ask, “How many people are dying?” And the other is to ask, “What is the risk of dying if you contract the virus?” For months, public health officials were unable to fully answer either of those questions.

Now, with death certificates and antibody-survey data coming in, we’re slowly getting a better picture of Covid-19 mortality. As we explain in this video, that picture is of a disease that’s killing more people than we knew, but a lower percentage of those infected. Most places are looking at a higher death count and lower death rate than previously reported.

But the biggest challenge in assessing a tragedy like this is that we’re still inside it — and nobody can predict how many lives will be lost before it ends.

If you want to stay totally safe from Covid-19, and eliminate the risk of either getting it or transmitting it, you have to stay home. But as the weather gets warmer, public places start to open up, and many places enter their fourth month of life under coronavirus, that’s becoming less and less realistic.

At the same time, we know that coronavirus can be transmitted through the air -- and that raises some pretty big questions. Is it safe to go the beach? What about a park? Is a heavy-breathing runner going to infect you as they pass you? In short: How do you go outside safely?

Become a Video Lab member! http://bit.ly/video-lab

As the rate of new coronavirus cases in the US slows down, many states and cities there are encouraging businesses to open again, easing the lockdowns that have been in place since March. But public health experts warn that in many of those places, opening up is premature.

The reason is that throughout the US, as well as in many other countries, we still don’t really know how many people have the virus, or where they are. That’s dangerous because it means infected people who don’t feel sick are probably mingling with the rest of the population, which could enable further outbreaks. And the only way to really prevent that is by proactively testing people for covid-19 until the people who have it have been tracked down and isolated.

The US started testing its population for covid-19 very slowly, but it’s since ramped testing up, and by early May was performing over 200,000 tests a day. Unfortunately, there’s no magic number of tests that is “enough” to contain an outbreak. The important thing is to test the right people — and to evaluate whether that’s happening, public health officials recommend looking at a different number: The percentage of tests coming back positive. It’s called the test positivity rate.

Across the US, black people are dying from Covid-19 at disproportionately high rates. While there are many different factors at play behind the stark racial disparities — there’s one possible reason that’s been lurking in the air for decades: pollution. 

The long history of segregation and housing discrimination has long put black people at greater risk of living near chemical plants, factories and highways, exposing them to higher levels of air pollutants. These pollutants have had a chronically negative impact on health, leading to conditions like hypertension and asthma. Now, those same diseases are associated with severe cases of Covid-19, and showing that where you live can determine whether you survive from Covid-19.

Subscribe to our channel! http://goo.gl/0bsAjO

In this episode of Vox Almanac, Vox’s Phil Edwards explores the story behind the women riveters of World War II.

During World War II, millions of women entered manufacturing and the workforce in general. How did the labor pool change so dramatically, so quickly? And how does it connect to the familiar poster of Rosie the riveter that people still love today?

These riveters came from other industries and outside the workforce, guided with the help of private industry and some government agencies. The US Employment Service helped place men and women at wartime jobs, and the Women’s Bureau and War Manpower Commission helped find and train that labor.

The traditional Rosie the riveter story is not without its omissions: white women benefited most from labor changes, and many of the riveters were already in the labor force before World War II began. But in a significant way, World War II did change work for women around the United States.

Further Reading

Karen Anderson’s Wartime Women (https://books.google.com/books/about/Wartime_Women.html?id=iSIqAAAAYAAJ) is the definitive book about Women’s Labor in World War II. It tells the story of the changing labor pool with extensive research into government, corporate, and union records.

FRASER, the Federal Reserve’s Library, is one of the easiest places to find Women’s Bureau records and papers (it’s where the ones in this video were downloaded from).

Subscribe to our channel! http://goo.gl/0bsAjO

Correction: At 4:28, a previous version of this video read  ""Federal Drug Administration."" It should read ""Food and Drug Administration.""

Dr. Anthony Fauci has become one of the most recognizable faces of the United States’ coronavirus response, as a member of the Coronavirus Task Force and director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. But it was an earlier crisis that shaped his career — and that’s crucial to understand his position today.

As the above video shows, Dr. Fauci’s involvement in the AIDS crisis, from the virus’s discovery to the present day, has affected the course of his career and the way the disease is treated around the world. That history, in turn, informs how we learn about and treat the coronavirus today.

In addition to scientific progress, AIDS also necessitated bureaucratic changes in the government response to the disease. By negotiating these challenges, Dr. Fauci secured his place in the public health system and changed how AIDS was treated.

Further Reading:

A topic as broad as the AIDS crisis, even narrowed to Dr. Fauci’s involvement, could have an endless reading list, from primary sources like ACT UP’s historical archive (https://actupny.org/documents/nyplPR.html) or one of Dr. Fauci’s early lectures on AIDs https://collections.nlm.nih.gov/catalog/nlm:nlmuid-101674642-vid.

However, these books provide particularly useful context on a complex story.

Few Americans alive today have ever seen unemployment numbers as bad as they are right now. At the end of April 2020, economists estimated that between 13 and 18 percent of US workers were unemployed. It's the highest rate since the Great Depression. 

That figure can seem somewhat inevitable; the unfortunate but unavoidable cost of economic lockdown. It’s why, in response, Congress has prioritized shoring up unemployment insurance benefits.

But a handful of European countries have shown that mass unemployment isn’t a given in a situation like this. It’s a policy choice. 

In this video, we explain how and why the UK, Denmark, and the Netherlands chose a different path. With the help of economist Heidi Shierholz of the Economic Policy Institute, we explore whether the US can still avoid millions more job losses.

Subscribe to our channel! http://goo.gl/0bsAjO

On April 7, 2020, as the coronavirus held much of the US under lockdown, the state of Wisconsin held an election. Many other states had already decided to delay their spring elections to protect voters. But in Wisconsin, voters were forced to choose between participating in the election, and their own safety. Wisconsin's decision sparked outrage, but it also highlighted a question that the US really needs to figure out soon: How do you hold an election during a pandemic?

Fortunately, there's actually a simple solution to this one: voting by mail. Tens of millions of Americans already vote this way, and if the rest of the US can prepare their election systems in time for the November election, they could avoid Wisconsin's fate. But time's running out.

Much of the data about the coronavirus epidemic and covid-19 is flawed. It is collected and reported in different ways by different countries, and almost certainly undercounts the number of cases and deaths. But organizations and journalists still need to report the available data to inform the public and help guide policymakers. Much of that data ends up in visualizations, like charts and maps, which can make it easier to understand and analyze.

But it's important to know how the process of data visualization can shape our perception of the crisis. In this video, we deconstruct one particularly popular chart of covid-19 cases around the world which uses a logarithmic scale, and explain how to avoid being misled by it.

Support Vox by joining the Video Lab at http://vox.com/join or making a one-time contribution: http://vox.com/contribute

The fight against coronavirus is global. But the guidelines on whether you should wear a face mask as part of that fight are often completely different from place to place. That means that, for a lot of people, whether you wear a face mask when you leave the house is basically up to you.

Here’s where almost every expert agrees: If you have Covid-19, and you leave the house, you should wear a mask. Masks help keep sick people from spreading their germs. Most of the uncertainty around mask use is related to a totally separate question: Whether masks can protect healthy people from getting Covid-19.

The truth is that no mask can actually guarantee that you won’t get sick; experts say one of the most dangerous assumptions about face masks is that they basically make you invincible. Masks have to be used correctly to offer any protection at all, and they’re most effective if used alongside other preventative measures like hand-washing and social distancing.

But experts also say that the question of whether healthy people should wear masks is a lot easier to answer when you consider one of Covid-19’s most dangerous characteristics: Because of the disease’s long incubation period, and the high occurrence of infected people who never feel symptoms at all, it’s almost impossible to be completely sure that you don’t already have it. And that means the safest course of action is ultimately for everyone to behave like a sick person; in other words, to wear a mask.

Is there a right way to play Monopoly?

Brian Valentine takes a stab at the answer — he was the United States representative to the 2015 World Monopoly championships, where he earned a third-place finish. As the above video shows, playing Monopoly right involves learning the rules all over again, processing key strategies, and, above all, valuing the people you play it with.

Valentine shares his knowledge about probability heat maps that show the likelihood of landing on a certain space, nuances of gameplay around houses and hotels, and even a few tips on making games fun instead of rancorous.

Further reading
There are tons of articles that break down the math of Monopoly. While it’s not the only ingredient to playing Monopoly right, it’s an important one. This Business Insider article by Walt Hickey is a great primer, and this Thrillist article by Daisy Barringer gives you even more tips.

If you work with (or have) kids under 7, you might notice that a handful of them flip letters, or sometimes entire words, when writing. It’s a little creepy to look at — and reminiscent of Danny from The Shining – but it’s entirely normal.

Our minds are exceptionally good at saving space when necessary. Sitting in a classroom, you probably won’t notice the consistent buzz of a heater unless you focus on it. Our eyes do something similar when it comes to orientation. This is because in the natural world, the direction something is facing doesn't really matter all that much. This allows us to identify and recognize objects quickly. It's a truly efficient way to think.

Except, when it comes to letters and numbers, where orientation *does* matter. In many ways, the written word is a completely unnatural system for our minds. The reverse of ""b"" turns it into a ""d."" Why is 3 left-facing when 5 and 6 are right-facing? It’s confusing because our minds don’t pay too much attention to orientation, and to get the alphabetic system right — we need to.

The images of SARS-CoV-2, the novel coronavirus that first appeared in humans in late 2019, were made using electron microscopy. The virus measures around 100 nanometers, and the smallest wavelengths of light that humans can see measure around 400 nanometers, meaning the virus is too small to see with a standard light microscope. To see something that small, you need a device that uses smaller wavelengths than light. Electrons, when accelerated in a field, behave as a wave with a tiny wavelength to accomplish this. 

Two electron microscopy techniques, SEM and TEM, offer different views. A Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) scans the surface of a sample and records information that bounces back, similar to a satellite image. A Transmission Electron Microscope (TEM) transmits electrons through a sample and projects a cross section of its inner structure. Together, these images help scientists observe the virus and how it moves in and out of host cells.

In South Korea, citizens have flattened the curve of the novel coronavirus -- and it's because of lessons they learned from fighting the MERS outbreak in 2015. Through a combination of aggressive and widespread testing measures, along with a system know as “contact tracing,” they’ve been better positioned to spot the path of the virus and curb its spread. While they are still vigilant for a second wave of Covid-19 cases, people in South Korea are slowly returning to public life. Watch the video above to find out how their testing and contact tracing measures work, and how it can be a lesson for countries still in lockdown.

It was an unusual process for an unprecedented task: keeping potential moon germs from entering the Earth’s atmosphere (and affecting its population).

To try to isolate the Apollo astronauts from the Earth, NASA went to extraordinary lengths. They clothed them in “Biological Isolation Garments,” transported them on a converted Airstream trailer, and then quarantined them for weeks in a Lunar Receiving Lab specially built to analyze moon samples and, of course, the men who went there.

The quarantine was a strange capstone to the journey to the moon — but also a necessary one that’s surprisingly resonant today.

During the coronavirus pandemic, scammers have sent several emails using the domain of the World Health Organization. Some are addressed from Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, the director-general of the WHO, and carry attachments that can install malware on the victim’s device. Others announce a coronavirus cure that you can read all about in an attachment. They each appear to be sent from the WHO's who.int email address. 

If it seems like it shouldn’t be this easy to impersonate a leading global health institution, you’re right. There is a way for organizations and companies to prevent spoofing of their domain using a free authentication system called DMARC, but the WHO, like many other companies and organizations, hasn’t done it.

Covid-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus, has similar symptoms to the flu. They also spread in similar ways. So it's natural to want to compare the two. But Covid-19 is very different, in ways that make it much more dangerous. And understanding how is key to understanding why we have to take it so seriously.

Become a Video Lab member! http://bit.ly/video-lab

In most developed countries, workers have the right to a certain number of paid sick days. It’s a policy that isn’t rooted in just generosity — during pandemics like the novel coronavirus, it can literally save lives. 

When workers have to choose between earning a living and staying home sick, it incentivizes them to come to work when they're ill, and potentially infect their colleagues and anyone else they come into contact with. That’s why public health officials are concerned that millions of American workers don’t have access to paid sick days. And a disproportionate share of those workers are concentrated in occupations like food service and hospitality, where there’s potential to infect the hundreds of customers many of them interact with every day.

Correction: At 1:18, islands in Canada, Denmark, Japan, Italy, and Australia are missing highlights.

“Social distancing,” also called physical distancing, is the best way to slow the spread of coronavirus and save lives in your community. It means leaving home as little as possible, keeping six feet away from others in public, and generally just limiting in-person social contact. But the rules of social distancing can be sort of blurry and confusing. Can you have close friends over for dinner? Can you visit relatives? Can you get on a plane if you’re wearing a face mask? What is life even supposed to look like without social contact?

We spoke with University of Pennsylvania social epidemiologist Carolyn Cannuscio about how we should think about social distancing, and what measures we should each be taking to do our part in slowing down the pandemic. Practicing social distancing properly isn’t easy, she says. But it’s also the best thing that each of us can do right now in the service of public health.

Read more about the Covid-19 coronavirus pandemic at http://vox.com/coronavirus

In March 2020, the World Health Organization officially classified Covid-19, the disease caused by the novel coronavirus, as a pandemic. That means the disease no longer constitutes just an outbreak or even an epidemic; the coronavirus has now spread around the world, and will continue to reach into other countries and communities.

That’s in part because of how contagious the virus is. When you’re infected with the flu, it takes about two days before you start to show symptoms. But coronavirus symptoms take an average of five to six days to appear, so it’s easy to spread well before you notice that you’re feeling sick. Many people are spreading it while going about their daily lives as usual.

The risk is that once coronavirus starts to spread in a community, about 20% of cases are severe and may require hospitalization. As those cases multiply, hospitals can fill up quickly. And people with severe cases of COVID-19 who can’t receive proper medical attention are at a much higher risk of dying.

Ideally, we would be able to stop the virus from spreading entirely. We can’t do that right now. What we can do is slow it down, so that the severe cases get spread out over a longer period of time, and hospitals are less likely to be overwhelmed on any given day. And that’s where each one of us comes in. The best way to slow down the spread is for everyone — healthy, sick, young, old — to limit social contact as much as possible, immediately. This is called social distancing, and it only works if enough of us do it. But if we do, it could mean the difference between the life and death of someone you know.

Subscribe to our channel! http://goo.gl/0bsAjO

On December 11th, 2019, India’s parliament passed a controversial new law: the Citizenship Amendment Act. The law fast-tracks citizenship for migrants from three neighboring countries, specifically if they are Hindus, Sikhs, Buddhists, Jains, Parsis, or Christians. It conspicuously leaves out Muslims.

Since the law was passed, it’s drawn widespread opposition and protests, and not only because it discriminates against Muslims. The law is also closely linked to another controversial initiative: the National Registry of Citizens, a citizenship list that could potentially leave millions of people, primarily Muslims, stateless. 

So far, only the northeastern state of Assam has implemented the NRC. In August 2019, the government of Assam published a citizenship list that left off nearly 2 million residents. And without the citizenship fast-track that the Citizenship Amendment Act grants to other religions, the Muslims left off that list are at risk of losing their citizenship entirely.

To understand the law, the national registry of citizens, the controversy they’ve ignited, and what might happen next, we spoke with Milan Vaishnav, Director of the South Asia Program at Carnegie Endowment for International Peace.

If you want to dive deep into the law, here’s both India’s original 1955 Citizenship Act and the 2019 Citizenship Amendment Act, which modifies the original law to provide a new path to citizenship based on religion:

Help our reporting on hidden histories. Submit a story idea here: http://bit.ly/2RhjxMy

With an explosion of tech companies and startups in recent decades, San Francisco has struggled with a massive affordable housing crisis. But the beginnings of that crisis go back much further than Silicon Valley. 

In 1968, a group of predominantly Filipino elders in San Francisco launched a battle to protect their home from eviction. Called the International Hotel, their home ended up in the crossroads of a city prioritizing the “Manhattanization” of its downtown area. Their fight for their neighborhood would evolve into a nearly decade-long protest with thousands of supporters and become a symbol of the campaign for affordable housing for decades to come.

In the Vox series Missing Chapter, Vox Senior Producer Ranjani Chakraborty revisits underreported and often overlooked moments from the past to give context to the present. Join her as she covers the histories that are often left out of our textbooks.

NOTE: As our expert Peter Li points out in the video, “The majority of the people in China do not eat wildlife animals. Those people who consume these wildlife animals are the rich and the powerful –a small minority.”  This video explains how the people of China are themselves victims of the conditions that led to coronavirus. The virus is affecting many different countries and cultures, and there is never justification for xenophobia or racism.

As of early March 2020, a new coronavirus, called COVID-19, is in more than 70 countries and has killed more than 3,100 people, the vast majority in China. That's where the virus emerged back in December 2019. This isn't a new phenomenon for China; in 2003, the SARS virus also emerged there, and under similar circumstances, before spreading around the world and killing nearly 800.

Both SARS and COVID-19 are in the ""coronavirus"" family, and both appear to have emerged from animals in China's notorious wildlife markets. Experts had long predicted that these markets, known to be potential sources of disease, would enable another outbreak. The markets, and the wildlife trade that supports them, are the underlying problem of these pandemics; until China solves that problem, more are likely to emerge.

Join the Open Sourced Reporting Network: http://www.vox.com/opensourcednetwork

Something big happened in the past year: Researchers created computer programs that can write long passages of coherent, original text.

Language models like GPT-2, Grover, and CTRL create text passages that seem written by someone fluent in the language, but not in the truth. That AI field, Natural Language Processing (NLP), didn’t exactly set out to create a fake news machine. Rather, it’s the byproduct of a line of research into massive pretrained language models: Machine learning programs that store vast statistical maps of how we use our language. So far, the technology’s creative uses seem to outnumber its malicious ones. But it’s not difficult to imagine how these text-fakes could cause harm, especially as these models become widely shared and deployable by anyone with basic know-how.

Elizabeth Warren is 70, but she’s a relative newcomer to politics. Before she became a US senator in 2012, she was a law professor. And in the early 2000s, she was driven by one question: Why, at a time when the economy seemed so good, were so many American families declaring bankruptcy?

The answers she found turned her into one of the country’s fiercest advocates for consumers. They helped change how we think about the economy itself. And, Vox’s Ezra Klein argues, it’s Warren’s understanding of America’s big, systemic problems that makes her uniquely qualified to be the next president.

So: What exactly is it that Elizabeth Warren understands? What kind of president would she be? And what does any of that tell us about how she would fare in a general election against Donald Trump?

Former Vice President Joe Biden has been a familiar face in American politics for decades. And he’s built his long career on personal relationships — relationships with fellow Democrats, but also with Republicans. More than any other candidate in this race, Biden’s campaign is defined by his belief that consensus among the parties isn’t only possible. It’s preferable. 

It’s an outlook shaped by Biden’s past experiences, and in an election defined by competing visions of the future, Biden’s nostalgic style stands out. But Vox’s Laura McGann argues that the case for Biden is all about where, and with whom, that moderate, nostalgic message will resonate. Because if you look to the election that won Democrats the House of Representatives in 2018, the message that drove that victory looks a lot like Biden’s.

So: What is that message exactly? What are Joe Biden's politics? And why are so many people convinced he can beat Donald Trump?

If he won the 2020 election, former South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg would become the youngest US president ever. And at 38 years old, his age puts him in good company with many of the Democrats’ recent successful nominees: Barack Obama, John F. Kennedy, and Bill Clinton.

But as Vox’s Dylan Matthews argues, that’s not Mayor Pete’s only similarity with recent Democratic presidents. Like Obama and Clinton before him, Buttigieg has a way of describing traditionally liberal ideas, like expanded access to health care and higher taxes on the wealthy, in a way that appeals to voters who don’t necessarily identify as liberals. 

So: What kind of president would Pete Buttigieg be? What makes him different from the other candidates in the race? And what would his advantage be in a general election against Donald Trump?

Bernie Sanders knows what energizes his crowds: Big ideas. Visions of political revolution. New ways of doing things. It’s why his supporters love him. But it’s also why many Democrats are still unsure about him.

But as Vox’s Matthew Yglesias argues, a good answer to that uncertainty can be found in Bernie Sanders’s political record; both as mayor of Burlington, Vermont, and as Vermont’s representative to the US House and Senate. Sanders is a lifelong politician. And if you look at what he’s done, there’s a lot to learn about what he would do if he actually became president.   

So: What does Sanders’s record actually tell us? What kind of president would he be? And what would his advantage be in a general election against Donald Trump?

Subscribe to our channel! http://goo.gl/0bsAjO

The Venus de Milo is iconic. Why? It turns out a missing piece might have something to do with it.

In this episode of Vox Almanac, Vox’s Phil Edwards explores the secret history of the Venus de Milo, the famous armless statue from Greece. Found in 1820, the Venus de Milo was always considered notable, but it’s a complicated political situation that made the statue iconic.

French art and the Louvre were struggling when Venus was discovered. A large cache of art — looted by Napoleon around the world — had recently been returned to various home countries, and that left a huge gap in the Louvre’s classical art collection. Venus was the perfect solution — and the French went to extreme lengths to make sure nobody questioned her legitimacy. The result was a globally famous statue with a complicated and secretive history.

The British royal family is very rich, but not as rich as you might think. And that’s because of a centuries-old model for how they make their income — and taboos about earning a private income outside of their official duties. 

Prince Harry and Meghan Markle are breaking free from the rules of how royals make money, which just might be a savvy financial decision.

Become a Video Lab member! http://bit.ly/video-lab

In 1966, Mao Zedong, China’s communist leader and the founder of the People’s Republic of China, was rumored to be in failing health. The devastating policies of his Great Leap Forward (1958-1962) — which forced millions of peasants to work tirelessly on government farming communes and by manufacturing crude steel — resulted in the greatest famine known to human history, costing anywhere between 23 and 55 million lives. 

Mao wanted to leave behind a powerful Communist legacy, like Marx and Lenin before him. And in order to do so, he needed to connect with the younger generation before he died. So after announcing his Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, he swam across the Yangtze River. Mao had done the same swim 10 years earlier to prove his vitality, and he hoped it would work again.

His ""Cultural Revolution"" was a call to hunt down and eliminate his enemies, and reeducate China’s youth with the principles Maoism. Led by the fanatical Red Guards, the Cultural Revolution was a devastating 10-year period in Chinese history that didn’t end until Mao died in 1976.

Become a Video Lab member! http://bit.ly/video-lab

When President Trump authorized the drone strike that killed the powerful Iranian general Qasem Soleimani, he wasn't just flexing America's muscle in the Middle East. 

He was also acting on the advice of a politically powerful group of evangelical Christians who believe that the US and Israel are part of the Bible's plan to bring about the second coming of Jesus. 

Once considered a fringe element of the religious right, evangelical Christian Zionists are playing an increasingly visible role in Republican politics. Today, unprecedented access to the Trump administration has given them an opportunity to reshape the Middle East.

Subscribe to our channel! http://goo.gl/0bsAjO

This year, the Westminster Dog Show will draw lots of attention. But no dog will surpass the legacy of the first Best in Show winner — a smooth fox terrier named Warren Remedy. In this episode of Vox Almanac, Vox's Phil Edwards explains how it happened.

Warren Remedy won three Best in Show titles at the Westminster Kennel Club Dog Show, and she cemented her place in canine history. But her legacy extends beyond her title — as an exemplar of the smooth fox terrier breed, she helped establish the “type” that people expected.

That was largely because of her breeder, a wealthy Manhattan socialite named Winthrop Rutherfurd. Rutherfurd famously dated a Vanderbilt before settling down with a vice president’s daughter, but in addition to lighting up the gossip pages, he bred fox terriers at his estate in Allamuchy, New Jersey. And he promoted them through the American Fox Terrier Club and Westminster Kennel Club. These efforts helped the relatively new breed gain a foothold in American culture.

Warren Remedy may never be surpassed in her three Best in Show titles. So was she the greatest dog of all time? That might be the wrong question. She was the greatest dog of her time, though, and that may have established an even more important legacy, for all dogs and for the Westminster Kennel Club Dog Show.

Further Reading: 
This archival article from Outing Magazine has a surprising interesting history of smooth terriers in America, including how the breed can be traced to just a few dogs.

1917, Avengers: Endgame, The Irishman, The Lion King, and Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker are five very different movies nominated for the same award: the 2020 Oscar for Visual Effects. Each movie is a masterpiece of computer generated art, from the Avengers’ time travel suits to Star Wars’ chase scenes to the incredible de-aging effects in The Irishman.

It’s easy to be awed by these effects — or to not even notice them. So we brought in Niko Pueringer, a visual effects artist from the production studio Corridor Digital, to help us break down the visual magic behind each film.

Become a Video Lab member! http://bit.ly/video-lab

The Best Picture nominee 1917 tells a pretty simple story: two British soldiers cross the no man’s land of World War I to warn a battalion of an impending ambush. What really makes the movie stand out is how director Sam Mendes and cinematographer Roger Deakins made the movie look like it was filmed in one continuous take. The techniques required to pull off hidden cuts have their roots in Alfred Hitchcock's movie Rope — and if you look closely, you can catch where they happen in 1917.

Become a Video Lab member! http://bit.ly/video-lab

Russia has the world’s largest reserves of natural gas, and most of it is controlled by the state-owned company Gazprom. But Gazprom has also built a global profile as a soccer sponsor. Good publicity for Gazprom means good publicity for Russia; since Gazprom is owned by the Russian state, domestic approval for the foreign energy provider can help build a reputation for Russia in places that might otherwise be wary of their creeping influence. And as Vladimir Putin pursues that influence abroad, building relationships with foreign business leaders using the sport of soccer has proven extremely useful. 

One place where that's been especially true is in Germany, where the team FC Schalke 04 has a longstanding sponsorship deal with Gazprom. When the deal was first signed in 2006, Russia was vying to increase their presence in the Western European gas market. Over a decade later, Gazprom sponsors one of Germany’s most popular soccer teams, and is about to open their second major direct pipeline from Russia to Germany.

A previous version of this video misidentified Switzerland on a map. The error has been corrected.

Bach's six cello suites are considered a rite of passage for cellists. They're masterpieces of classical music, and the prelude in G major — the first movement of the suites — is perhaps the best example of Bach's power as a composer. In it, he's able to achieve rich and complex harmonic movements with just a four-stringed instrument, while using the very basic tenets of music composition. Those basic tenets are what Alisa Weilerstein, a renowned cellist and McArthur fellow, helps us understand. 

A previous version of this video mislabeled a C sharp as a C natural. We also removed a simplified chord visual that mislabeled a C natural as a C sharp.

Correction: In a previous version of this video, we mistakenly labelled Iran's Ayatollah Ali Khamenei as Ayatollah Khomeini. We regret the error.

Before Qassem Soleimani was killed in a US air strike in Iraq, he was arguably Iran's second most important leader. He commanded the soldiers and spies of Iran's elite Quds Force, a group whose job was to forge partnerships with militias across the Middle East, through which Soleimani spread Iran's influence and his own. From Hezbollah in Lebanon to the many Shia militias in Iraq, these groups played a central role in the medley of wars that have roiled the Middle East for the last few decades. Soleimani didn't invent Iran's use of proxy militias; that dates back to at least 1979, when Iran's new regime looked around the region and found many enemies and few friends. But 40 years later, thanks in part to Soleimani's work, Iran has the advantage in the Middle East.

Help our reporting on hidden histories. Submit a story idea here: http://bit.ly/2RhjxMy

If you’ve been to New York, you’ve probably visited Central Park. But there’s a part of its story you won't see. 

It’s a story that goes back to the 1820s, when that part of New York was largely open countryside. Soon it became home to about 1,600 people. Among them was a predominantly black community that bought up affordable plots to build homes, churches and a school. It became known as Seneca Village. And when Irish and German immigrants moved in, it became a rare example at the time of an integrated neighborhood.

Everything changed on July 21, 1853. New York took control of the land to create what would become the first major landscaped park in the US -- they called it “The Central Park.” 

In the Vox series Missing Chapter, Vox Senior Producer Ranjani Chakraborty revisits underreported and often overlooked moments from the past to give context to the present. Join her as she covers the histories that are often left out of our textbooks. Our first season tackles stories of racial injustice, political conflicts, even the hidden history of US medical experimentation.

Correction: A previous version of this video had the date January 7, 2019 at 0:11 and sourced the Department of Western Australia at 0:24. It has been corrected to January 7, 2020 and the Government of Western Australia. The current version also corrects an error at 2:10 and 2:29 where our voiceover mixed up East and West.

Australia’s recent fire season has been hellish with no end in sight. At least 17.9 million acres have burned, 28 people have died, and an estimated 1 billion animals have been lost. But while Australia burns, East Africa has been grappling with record-breaking rainfall leading to catastrophic floods. Both have a common cause — and it lies in the Indian Ocean.

One billion animals are estimated to have died — among them, the iconic koala.

Koalas were already threatened before the Australia fires broke out. Decades of human activity has whittled their population down dramatically. But after this year’s fire season, experts believe koalas are now in danger of becoming extinct — unless policy changes are put in place to save them.

In this episode of Vox Almanac, Vox's Phil Edwards explores the real meaning of life.

Subscribe to our channel! http://goo.gl/0bsAjO

The original game of Life was depressing. Really depressing.

When we think of the Game of Life, the candy-colored 1950s and '60s version comes to mind — featuring the glossy American dream of buying a house, piling kids in the car, and becoming a millionaire.

Born in 1836, Milton Bradley grew up in Lowell, Massachusetts, where he dropped out of college to begin a career in the printing business. He quickly acquired a monopoly — he owned one of the only lithography machines in Massachusetts outside of Boston — and it made him a wild success.

But in 1860, disaster struck. Bradley had printed thousands of portraits of Abraham Lincoln, hoping for strong sales based on Lincoln's presidential nomination. Unfortunately, Lincoln grew a beard in the meantime, and the portraits failed to sell, nearly bankrupting Bradley.

From that failure, however, his greatest success was born. Soon thereafter, Bradley invented the Checkered Game of Life, with the game's board mirroring the ups and downs of his own career. It turned out to be a hit. In 1866, Bradley patented the game and secured his fortune.

After Milton Bradley died in 1911, the game of Life began to transform from board-game-as-moral-tract to board-game-as-escape. The version familiar to modern players makes success all about money and achievement rather than virtue. 

That makes a couple of questions surprisingly tricky to answer: What should the meaning of Life be? And which version of the game is actually more depressing?

Join the Open Sourced Reporting Network: http://www.vox.com/opensourcednetwork

Google, Microsoft, and Amazon have been very vocal about their efforts to reduce the world's dependence on fossil fuels. But as The Wall Street Journal and Gizmodo have reported, these same companies are currently teaming up with fossil fuel industry to help them squeeze as much oil and gas out of the ground as possible. 

Oil has always been hard to find and hard to extract, and so the industry has teetered precariously on the edge of profitability several times over the course of its history. Over and over again, experts have predicted that we'll soon run out of accessible, affordable oil – but so far, they've been wrong. Just when things look bleakest for black gold, new technology swoops in to keep the industry afloat.

Become a Video Lab member! http://bit.ly/video-lab

When you think of the ancient world, you probably picture towering buildings of white marble, adorned with statues also made of white marble. You’re not alone — most people picture the same thing. But we’re all wrong. 

Ancient buildings and sculptures were actually really colorful. The Greeks and Romans painted their statues to resemble real bodies, and often gilded them so they shone like gods. So why is seemingly every museum on planet earth full of white marble sculptures? 

It’s partly an honest mistake. After the fall of Rome, ancient sculptures were buried or left out in the open air for hundreds of years. By the time the Renaissance began in the 1300s, their paint had faded away. As a result, the artists unearthing, and copying ancient art didn’t realize how colorful it was supposed to be.

But white marble couldn’t have become the norm without some willful ignorance. Even though there was a bunch of evidence that ancient sculpture was painted, artists, art historians and the general public chose to disregard it. Western culture seemed to collectively accept that white marble was simply prettier. 

Today, art history is more concerned with accuracy than it is with what might look better. So teams of researchers use a combination of art and science to painstakingly create reconstructions of ancient statues, showing us the true colors of classical antiquity.

Most of the reconstruction work shown in this video was done by the Polychromy Research Project, led by conservationists Vinzenz Brinkmann and Ulrike Koch-Brinkmann. To see more of their work you can buy their book, “Gods in Color: Polychromy in the Ancient World” https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/570229/gods-in-color-by-vinzenz-brinkmann/9783791357072

You might have heard that the poor in America barely pay any taxes. And if you look at a chart of how much every American pays in income taxes, that seems basically true. But income taxes are just one type of the many taxes we pay. So what happens if we add them all up? A new analysis by the economists Emmanuel Saez and Gabriel Zucman did exactly that. And it shows that the American tax system might not be as ""progressive"" as many people believe.

Donald Trump is the 3rd president in American history to be impeached by the House of Representatives, joining Andrew Johnson and Bill Clinton. Richard Nixon resigned before the House voted on the articles of impeachment.

But this is the middle, not the end, of the impeachment process – Trump is now officially charged with the abuses of power laid out in the House’s articles of impeachment, but will be tried in the Republican-majority senate. But what will congressional Republicans accept, and what will that mean for future presidents?  What we know so far paints a dangerous picture.

When Harry Styles released the album cover to his sophomore project, Fine Line, fans began dissecting everything about it. But any music lover might recognize something about its cover too. The distorted circular image might remind hip-hop fans of 1990s music videos, or psychedelic rock fans of an iconic Jimi Hendrix album cover. The photograph was taken with a fish-eye lens, a novel piece of gear that has excited amateur and professional photographers alike for over half a century. The story of how that lens was developed in the first place might be just as interesting as all the ways it has been used since its invention.

Become a Video Lab member! http://bit.ly/video-lab

In the years leading up to the United States’ entry into World War I in 1917, the nation was neutral, profiting from the war by manufacturing munitions and selling them to both sides. But a British naval blockade around Germany made it impossible for the Central Powers to acquire American arms. As a result, Imperial Germany established a ring of saboteurs and spies within the US, secretly destroying munitions factories and ships, and trying to make it look like an accident. 

The signature attack of this campaign occurred on July 30, 1916, when saboteurs set fire to a massive stockpile of munitions ready to ship from Black Tom Island, a munitions depot in New York Harbor. The explosion was felt for miles around, but because the US had no infrastructure of domestic intelligence at the times, it took decades to prove that it wasn’t just an unfortunate accident. This German sabotage campaign ultimately laid the groundwork for the establishment of domestic intelligence agencies specializing in counter-espionage in the US.

That means while you’re trying to pick what to watch next, you’re likely to spot some of these tropes littered throughout the trailers for the 2019 releases hankering for a nomination. Hot-button issues in Bombshell? Check. Prosthetics? (Yeah, you’ve got to see the cast member in Bombshell to know that will be a Best Actor nominee.) Nostalgia galore plus “based on a true story” in A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood? Check. Watch for more tropes that are hard to miss in this year’s potential nominee films.

Join the Open Sourced Reporting Network: http://www.vox.com/opensourcednetwork

Human faces evolved to be highly distinctive; it’s helpful to be able to recognize individual members of one’s social group and quickly identify strangers, and that hasn’t changed for hundreds of thousands of years. Then in just the past five years, the meaning of the human face has quietly but seismically shifted. That’s because researchers at Facebook, Google, and other institutions have nearly perfected techniques for automated facial recognition.
 
The result of that research is that your face isn’t just a unique part of your body anymore, it’s biometric data that can be copied an infinite number of times and stored forever. In this video, we explain how facial recognition technology works, where it came from, and what’s at stake.

In this episode of Vox Almanac, Vox’s Phil Edwards goes to Florida to answer a question: why did one city reject the movie industry?

In the early 1900s, the New York-centric film scene was in search of a warm-weather capital. Two contenders emerged: Los Angeles, California, and Jacksonville, Florida. And for a while, it was unclear which city would win the movie business. Jacksonville boasted a large industry, proximity to New York, and great weather. Some early comedy classics were even made there.

But ultimately, the city wasn’t ready to become a movie town. The compromises of life with the movie industry — like actors and actresses running loose around town — proved too much for the Jacksonville establishment. The people of the city effectively voted against the movies when they voted against the industry’s biggest political booster.

This footnote in history isn’t just trivia though — it shows how our culture could have had an alternate set of stories. That’s particularly obvious when it comes to Norman Studios, a film studio that endured in Jacksonville by casting black actors while much of the Hollywood establishment still relied on stereotypical roles or blackface. But we’ll never know what might have gone differently — Hollywood became “Hollywood,” and Jacksonville became a story in the archives.

Further reading:

Blair Miller’s book, Almost Hollywood, is a comprehensive look at the movie production scene in Jacksonville. It relies heavily on newspaper reports from the time (which is invaluable because it’s difficult to find digitized versions online).

Become a Video Lab member! http://bit.ly/video-lab

When parents are researching where to move, they typically look at the quality of a neighborhood's schools. But good data on that is hard to find. That's where a website called GreatSchools has thrived. GreatSchools rates almost every public school in America on a scale of 1 to 10. But when we analyzed those ratings, we found that they almost never give high scores to schools in poor neighborhoods — even though data from their own website shows that many of those schools do a good job teaching students. 

This video is a collaboration with Chalkbeat, an education news site. To read more about GreatSchools' ratings, read their story here: https://www.chalkbeat.org/posts/us/2019/12/05/greatschools-ratings-poverty-race-segregation-housing 

EdWeek reported on how GreatSchools changed its ratings system in 2017: https://www.edweek.org/ew/articles/2017/11/01/school-rating-site-greatschools-expands-its-measuring-stick.html

And recently, researchers have found that the GreatSchools ratings may even have an effect on housing prices, locking poor people out of more affluent neighborhoods: https://www.chalkbeat.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Digitization_and_Divergence__Paper_-2.pdf

Networks now know the best way to capture a captive, Christmas-craving audience, and it’s with new, original movies. In fact, Hallmark plans to release nearly 50 new movies just this year. (Cue the holiday romance tropes!)

But it’s not just original holiday content that has platforms competing for our eyeballs. Movie studios have long noted that the holiday season is one of the more fruitful seasons to release new movies, like the James Bond franchise. Now, streaming platforms are taking the same cue. The most recent example you’d be hard-pressed to escape? Netflix’s Birdbox. The Sandra Bullock post-apocalyptic thriller was released the Friday before Christmas. In the week between Christmas and New Year’s Day, the movie was seen by more than 45 million accounts.

What’s the secret to winning the holiday content war? This roundtable of experts — Jordan Carlos, comedian; Angelique Roche, pop culture journalist; and Ben Selkow, filmmaker — agree that it’s not just the new original content that makes for a yearly Christmas tradition. It also comes down to the familiar classics you’ve practically memorized line by line. Go inside the holiday content war and see just how far platforms will go to keep you entertained this season.

One breakthrough made animation look natural. And it involved a clown dancing on a roof.

In this episode of Vox Almanac, Vox’s Phil Edwards explores the beginning of rotoscoping, a technique animators can use to create realistic motion. Invented by Max Fleischer of Fleischer Studios (and echoed and practiced by many others), it involves taking filmed footage and using it as a traceable model for animation. The results are fluid and natural in a way animation had never been before.

As the above video shows, it started with Max’s brother Dave dancing on a roof in a clown costume. Footage of that was then used to model the classic Koko the Clown cartoons, which formed the basis for many Fleischer Studios films. Today, animators still use techniques like rotoscoping to turn real movement into animation.

Become a Video Lab member! http://bit.ly/video-lab

The mating ritual of the sage grouse is one of nature's most bizarre and alluring performances. It's also very predictable, which makes the bird really easy to count. That's part of why the sage grouse is what's known as an indicator species, meaning that its survival tends to correlate with the health of its entire ecosystem. It's also why the sage grouse was recently the target of one of the largest conservation efforts in US history. And it means that if we lose the sage grouse, there's a good chance we'll have lost a lot of the other 350 plant and animal species that live in the American west, too. 

A previous version of this video misidentified the bird at 0:58. The error has been corrected.

Become a Video Lab member! http://bit.ly/video-lab

“Whistleblowing” is when someone exposes a secret in their organization. And in the US, it’s often hailed as a heroic act. But within the government, whistleblowing is often perilous—especially when it involves classified information.

If a whistleblower goes to the media with classified information, that’s illegal. And since the Obama administration, it’s become common for the government to prosecute people who do it by charging them under a law from 1917 that was originally intended to prosecute spies for helping foreign governments. If a whistleblower files a complaint through internal channels instead, the complaint has to go through the head of the intelligence community before it can see the light of day—and after that, there are few protections against disclosing the whistleblower’s identity, and only weak recourses against retaliation. 

In August 2019, a CIA officer filed a complaint about an alleged quid pro quo between President Trump and the President of Ukraine. The complaint made it to Congress, and kicked off impeachment proceedings. But the existing laws don’t guarantee that this whistleblower will be protected, either.

[Advertiser content from Dell],2019-11-26 17:59:20+00:00,"The most creative enthusiasts, cultural critics and cinephiles have a lot to say when it comes to talking shop about film, television and Hollywood. In this three-part series, Streaming Straight Talk, Vox Creative and Dell will dive into the hot topics that define this new golden age of streaming and consuming content.

Forty-five hours per year: That’s about how long the average American consumer spends choosing what to watch next. You may not think those 7.4 minutes per day amounts to much, but on the whole, Americans spend more time than ever before simply choosing the next title to click “play” on.

Why? The onslaught of streaming platforms has much to do with it (looking at all of you who spent the weekend on the couch with their new Disney+ subscription), but so do the algorithms that fuel the paralyzing “watch next” conundrum. But even in the age of the algorithm, humans still play a key roll in recommending content. And platforms like Netflix and HBO now offer even more tools that include streaming recs curated by humans. The question becomes, which serves us better to choose what to watch next (and lets us gain that 45 hours of our year back): the human, or the machine?

In this episode of Streaming Straight Talk, the roundtable of panelists — Jordan Carlos, comedian; Angelique Roche, pop culture journalist; and Ben Selkow, filmmaker — share their personal recommendations for the shows they’re binging, and weigh in on the difference of word of mouth versus the algorithm.

In this episode of Vox Almanac, Vox’s Phil Edwards explores the delightfully strange beginning of stop motion animation. In a stop motion movie, an animator arranges an object, takes a picture, slightly adjusts the positioning, and then does it all over again. When the pictures are played in succession, it looks like motion. Though people have been experimenting with stop motion since the beginning of film, the new art really took off when an insect collector named Wladyslaw Starewicz (later Ladislas Starevich, among other spellings) wanted to see his beetles move.

His 1912 film, The Cameraman’s Revenge, was the most significant of those early experiments. By that time, he’d been discovered as a precocious museum director in a Lithuanian Natural History Museum, and that enabled him to make movies. The Cameraman’s Revenge was his boldest experiment yet, depicting a tryst between star-crossed (bug) lovers.

As the above video shows, he employed technical innovations to do so, including strings that controlled his unusual puppets. He also occasionally replaced legs and augmented their bodies with wheels to enhance his stop motion process. The results are strange, hilarious, and changed the medium.

Starewicz went on to animate many other classics in the genre, influencing filmmakers like Terry Gilliam and Wes Anderson. And that legacy all started with the improbable story of cheating bugs and the museum director who loved them.

Brazil has over 900,000 indigenous people, most of whom live in the Amazon. After centuries of persecution, they were given extensive rights under a new Constitution in the 1980s, including the right to claim and win back their traditional lands. Since then, hundreds of indigenous lands have been demarcated and protected by the Brazilian government.

But in the last few years, those lands have come under attack by landowners, ranchers, loggers, and farmers who want access to the resources inside these indigenous lands. And since Jair Bolsonaro became president, the number of invasions into indigenous lands has skyrocketed.

The Amazon rainforest has faced encroachment and deforestation for a long time. But it wasn’t until Brazil’s military dictatorship came to power in the 1970s that deforestation spiked, becoming a big business in the Amazon. When that expansion reached the state of Acre, it met resistance. Chico Mendes, a rubber tapper from the region, took the fight to protect the Amazon from the depths of the rainforest to the global stage. In the process, he gave his life. But the fight he started lives on.

To understand the history of the Amazon and how Chico Mendes changed the course of that history, watch the video above, our second episode of Atlas’ Amazon miniseries.

The Amazon rainforest has been reduced by about 17% since the 1970s. Cattle ranchers, loggers, and farmers are mostly to blame for the deforestation, but the demand driving them comes from all around the world. Brazil's economy depends on agriculture, especially beef and soy, which is grown on cleared land in the Amazon. Today, president Jair Bolsonaro, is weakening the environmental protections there in order to give agriculture more power. This came to a head when, in summer 2019, more than 30,000 wildfires burned in the Amazon, sparking worldwide outrage. 

Here are some sources I found particularly helpful while reporting for this story:

Why are movies about two hours long? In this episode of Vox Almanac, Vox’s Phil Edwards researches the history of movies — and discovers the Italian silent film classic that changed movies forever.

Subscribe to our channel! http://goo.gl/0bsAjO

In the 1900s, movies were typically around 15 minutes long — that was the length of one reel (depending on playback speed and a few other variables). But in 1913, that changed significantly thanks to the blockbuster “Quo Vadis” — a two-hour epic that wasn’t just long, but had blockbuster ambitions.

Quo Vadis involved huge stunts, thousands of extras, and real Roman locations, taking movies to a scale little before seen. When it premiered, instead of playing as one of many short films in nickelodeons, it debuted in big concert halls and other prestigious venues. That led to a record box office and an industry-changing trend that started with director DW Griffith and spread elsewhere.

If you want to read more, I relied on the following books:
A History of Narrative Film by David A. Cook
https://wwnorton.com/books/A-History-of-Narrative-Film
This book provides a good overview of film history.

Film Before Griffith by John Fell
https://books.google.com/books/about/Film_Before_Griffith.html?id=D-2THyVl7ysC
This book chronicles all the films that influenced movies before DW Griffith came on the stage.

The Silent Cinema by Liam O’Leary
https://books.google.com/books/about/The_silent_cinema.html?id=pqFZAAAAMAAJ
Another good overview to look at the international silent film scene.

The Griffith Project
https://www.amazon.com/Griffith-Project-12-Essays-D-W/dp/1844572684
Many silent films are lost, so anthologies like these, which describe each film and include data on length, are useful.

Most things in society are built for, and designed around, a specific “reference man."" This “standard human” is usually a white male in his 30s who weighs around 155 pounds. When we design everything from cars, to air-conditioned offices, to city streets, reference man is the default user. And when it comes to healthcare, that can mean deadly effects for women. 

Note: The headline on this piece has been updated.
Previous headline: Everything is designed for men, even drugs

Watch the video above to find out how dosages are determined with “reference man” in mind. After dozens of women got into car accidents under the influence of sleeping pills they'd taken the night before, the FDA had to tell women to cut their dose in half; it turned out, women metabolize Ambien's active ingredient twice as slowly as men. What was supposed to be a “gender-neutral” dose was anything but. We also speak with Diana Zuckerman, president of the National Center for Health Research, who explains why we need more inclusivity in clinical trials — for women, for people over 65, and for people of color.

Become a Video Lab member! http://bit.ly/video-lab

In the coldest parts of the world, there’s a layer of soil that stays frozen all year. This layer is called permafrost; it exists mainly around the Arctic, and acts kind of like a giant freezer. As plants and animals in those regions die, some of them become preserved in this permafrost. 

But as human activity releases greenhouse gases into the atmosphere, the permafrost is starting to thaw and shrink. That’s having some dramatic consequences — and not just for people who live in the Arctic.

Become a Video Lab member! http://bit.ly/video-lab

When you picture hippies, you probably picture bell bottoms, long hair, and LSD. You might also think of a very specific graphic design and illustration style, seen on concert posters and album covers: curly, cloudy, barely legible lettering, trippy color combinations, and decorative meandering borders. This style was first conceived in San Francisco by a handful of designers in the late 1960s. Their job? Make posters for bands like The Byrds, the Grateful Dead, Janis Joplin, Steve Miller Band, Jimi Hendrix … all of whom were just getting their start, competing for nightly stage time at venues like the Fillmore and the Avalon.  

But these designers didn’t invent that now-iconic style. In fact, they were heavily influenced by an art movement that started in the late 1800s called Art Nouveau.

The Trump administration has opened up America's public lands to mining and fossil fuel companies on an unprecedented scale, lifting decades-long protections from millions of acres of wilderness across the country. In Minnesota, one proposed copper mine is pitting neighbors against each other as they weigh the benefits of new mining jobs against the environmental consequences of new mines. It’s an old American debate that’s been further complicated here by an unforgiving reality: We need copper, and there are not that many places to get it.

In this episode of Vox Almanac, producer Phil Edwards explores the history behind the groundbreaking CGI (Computer Generated Imagery) in 1973’s Westworld. The film drew inspiration from a surprising source: the photographs taken by the Mars Mariner flyby of the red planet in the mid-1960s.

Designer and artist John Whitney saw the Mariner photos and though their distinctive appearance was a good template — as well as technical model — for the computer vision of a robot character in Westworld. In replicating the NASA achievement, he notched his own historic first for CGI in film.

It's a landmark moment for visual effects, computer graphics, and the movies.

https://art19.com/shows/today-explained/episodes/19d61e8b-55f6-4f57-a1be-49f8f5bb7828

In October 2019, Houston Rockets general manager Daryl Morey posted a tweet supporting pro-democracy protests in Hong Kong. In reaction, the Chinese government censored NBA broadcasts in China, and Chinese companies suspended business deals with the world's premiere basketball league. As the controversy spun out of control, NBA commissioner Adam Silver, Houston Rockets star James Harden, and NBA All-Star LeBron James were all asked for their opinion on the growing crisis. In this video, we dive deep into the relevant history that led to this critical moment.

For decades, the NBA has been pushing a business strategy to attract fans in China, where basketball is more popular than in the United States. At the same time, the government of the United States has been pursuing a trade policy with China intended to generate profit for American businesses while simultaneously exposing Chinese consumers and businesses to ideas of democracy and free speech through the transactional dynamics of globalization. Originally, the hope of US leaders like President Bill Clinton was that this trade would lead to the democratization of China. What China's fight with the NBA shows is that the opposite seems to be occurring.

The fall of the Berlin Wall has a lot of memorable moments: US President Ronald Reagan’s declaration to “tear down this wall”; David Hasselhoff singing at the Brandenburg Gate; and Berliners wielding pickaxes and hammers, tearing apart the visible symbol of a divided Europe. 

But a less spectacular moment actually triggered the crumbling of the wall. It happened at a routine press conference on November 9th, 1989, when East German spokesperson Günter Schabowski was handed an announcement about relaxed travel regulations. In his lack of preparation, he mistakenly insinuated that the checkpoints in the Berlin Wall — which up until then were guarded by soldiers with orders to shoot anyone trying to cross — were now open (das sofort, unverzüglich). They weren’t, but that announcement was all East Berliners needed to storm the wall and demand they be allowed to cross into West Berlin. After that, the wall became obsolete, and soon fell.

Help our reporting on hidden histories. Submit a story idea here: http://bit.ly/2RhjxMy

Starting in the 1950s, a Florida state committee spent years stalking, intimidating, and outing hundreds of LGBTQ people. And they got away with it. Amid a national witch hunt for communists and an ascendant civil rights movement, a group of Florida politicians with a mission to preserve racial segregation in the state created a powerful group called the Florida Legislative Investigation Committee.

Commonly called the ""Johns Committee"" for the influential state senator Charley Johns who spearheaded it, the Committee went after civil rights activists by arguing they were backed by communists. But when those investigations failed, they turned to a new group to target: LGBTQ people. Today, over 50 years later, some Florida legislators are calling for the state to finally come to terms with this part of its history.

On Oct. 9, 2019, Turkey launched an attack in northeastern Syria. Turkey made the move shortly after the US announced it would remove some of its troops from the region. 

Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan had his eyes on the region for years. Turkey, he argued, needed a “safe zone” to serve as a buffer against the Syrian War happening just across the border. Yet back home in Turkey, there were other factors at play that accelerated his calls for an invasion that involved Erdoğan’s own political survival.

The move has recalibrated alliances in the Syrian War and added new uncertainty on the future of the region.

Become a Video Lab member! http://bit.ly/video-lab

When European settlers first came to America they were set on “civilizing” the land. This meant a lot of rash, sweeping changes — one of which was to eradicate a familiar target: the gray wolf. Bounties were placed on the animal across the US. By the 1930s, the once plentiful wolf population was decimated. 

Decades later, restorations efforts have led to an extensive recovery of the animal. The Fish and Wildlife Service thinks we’ve done enough, but conservationists say our work is far from done. Check out the video above to learn more.

When Republican mapmaker Thomas Hofeller died in 2018, we learned exactly how far Republicans were willing to go to gerrymander political districts — and rig elections to give themselves majorities in statehouses and Congress.

Here's Hofeller's obituary from 2018, before his files were released: https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/21/obituaries/thomas-hofeller-republican-master-of-political-maps-dies-at-75.html

Toward the end of the 19th century, the US took thousands of Native American children and enrolled them in off-reservation boarding schools, stripping them of their cultures and languages. Yet decades later as the US phased out the schools, following years of indigenous activism, it found a new way to assimilate Native American children: promoting their adoption into white families.

Become a Video Lab member! http://bit.ly/video-lab

If you've ever felt unsure about how much to tip your driver on apps like Uber or Lyft, you're not alone. There's a lot of confusion around tipping etiquette on app-based rides, and much of it can be traced back to Uber's beginnings. As the app that made ride-hailing a thing in the first place, Uber established many of the standards around how we use those services, including the forgoing of tips. But as the ride-hail market has changed, that's become less of a good deal for drivers.

To learn more about the average pay and tips of an Uber driver, check out this survey by Ridester: https://www.ridester.com/2018-survey/

...and this study by the Economic Policy Institute: https://www.epi.org/publication/uber-and-the-labor-market-uber-drivers-compensation-wages-and-the-scale-of-uber-and-the-gig-economy/

It shows Trump asking a foreign country to investigate a man who could challenge him in the 2020 election: Joe Biden.

_V10kWLh71U,Vox,UCLXo7UDZvByw2ixzpQCufnA,Why this chair is on so many album covers,2019-10-04 12:00:07+00:00,"A lot of celebrity butts sat in this chair.

Become a Video Lab member! http://bit.ly/video-lab

The golden age of album cover design doesn’t have a specific start and end date, but many regard the late 1960s to 1970s as one of the field's most exciting times. From the psychedelic rock covers of the '60s to glistening airbrush covers of the '70s, the era was a kaleidoscope of colors worthy of placement in modern art museums. 

But there’s one genre of cover so ubiquitous it almost flew under the radar. The covers typically featured a wide shot of the artist sitting on a throne-like wicker chair, like a king or queen. Usually, the artist looked casual and relaxed; sometimes props would sit around them to decorate the scene. No matter what, the oversized woven chair was the main feature. This was the peacock chair album cover, and it was everywhere: Dolly Parton, Al Green, and Cher all sat in it. 

This might seem like a weird blip of a trend over a few years in the 1970s, but a closer look reveals how deep the wicker chair portrait tradition goes. Spoiler alert: a full century. The video above tracks the origin of the peacock wicker chair portrait and tells the unlikely story of where this giant chair came from.

A detailed account of the history of wicker furniture and its place in pop culture was documented by Emily A. Morris in her paper The Development and Effects of the Twentieth-Century Wicker Revival: https://repository.si.edu/bitstream/handle/10088/18611/The%20Development%20and%20Effects%20of%20the%20Twentieth-Century%20Wicker%20Revival.pdf

Get the latest on the Trump-Ukraine scandal on Vox.com: https://www.vox.com/2019/9/26/20885233/trump-impeachment-ukraine-biden

President Donald Trump faces possible impeachment after repeatedly asking the president of Ukraine to investigate Joe Biden, Trump’s chief domestic political rival, a week after Trump froze Ukraine's military aid. When Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky brought up the aid, Trump responded, “I would like you to do us a favor though,” and turned the conversation to Biden. All of this is confirmed in a call record released by Trump’s own White House. There's now an impeachment inquiry as a result of this revelation.

In 1788's Federalist 65, Alexander Hamilton considers the problem of impeachment. The process, the Constitution framer writes, is meant for offenses “denominated POLITICAL, as they relate chiefly to injuries done immediately to the society itself.” 

Fundamentally, Hamilton believed it was the task of an impartial Senate to decide whether or not to convict a president that has been impeached. Hamilton, however, hadn't envisioned a Senate as partisan as the current one. 

Still, even a broken impeachment process has its uses. The Senate may refuse its role, but through a properly designed impeachment process, the House can focus the public’s attention, send a message to the world, and create a record for the future.

Become a Video Lab member! http://bit.ly/video-lab

Towering red rock formations and big blue sky make up the classic backdrop of the American West. But the rocks we see in so many movies aren't typical of the area at all. In fact, they are unique to one place: Monument Valley. 

Monument Valley is on the Utah-Arizona border inside the Navajo Nation Reservation, and until the 20th century, it had barely been visited by non-indigenous people. But when John Ford made Stagecoach — the 1939 blockbuster that mainstreamed Western movies and the actor John Wayne — that all changed. More filmmakers followed suit and used the location as their movie backdrop, creating a deep association between Monument Valley’s iconic landscape and the mythic American West. 

To read more on the myth of the American West and Western movies, check out Richard Slotkin’s “Gunfighter Nation,” a thorough history of the genre: https://oupress.com/books/9780611/gunfighter-nation

Become a Video Lab member! http://bit.ly/video-lab

Correction: Mozart’s Requiem isn’t a symphony, it’s a requiem: a type of Catholic mass for the dead. It was initially written for mass but later popularized and performed outside the church, as was Verdi's.

Think back to some of the most dramatic scenes in film history — from The Lion King, The Shining, It’s a Wonderful Life. Besides being sad or scary, they have something else in common: the dies irae. “Dies irae” translates from Latin to “Day of Wrath” — it’s a 13th-century Gregorian chant describing the day Catholics believe God will judge the living and the dead and send them to heaven or hell. And it was sung during one specific mass: funerals.

As Catholicism permeated world culture, the melody of the chant was repurposed into classical music, where it was used to convey a deathly, eerie tone. From there it worked its way into films — and if you don’t already know it, you’ve almost certainly heard it before: It’s played over and over in our scariest and most dramatic cinematic moments. 

Here’s Alex Ludwig’s original supercut of movies featuring the dies irae: https://youtu.be/GLGa6vfDTIM 

There are so many references to the dies irae in classical music that we couldn’t include. One is Sergei Rachmaninoff’s 1908 “symphonic poem” Isle of the Dead (https://youtu.be/dbbtmskCRUY?t=1032). He was inspired by this painting from Swiss artist Arnold Böcklin that shows a coffin and white figure on their way to a small island (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isle_of_the_Dead_(painting)).

Alex briefly touched on the differences between the ancient dorian mode and the modern minor mode. There’s a ton written online about them, but here’s a good place to start if you’re curious: https://www.musical-u.com/learn/get-familiar-with-the-dorian-mode/#

THE MIND, EXPLAINED takes a five-episode deep dive into how our brains handle memory, anxiety, psychedelics and dreams. Narrated by Emma Stone.

After nearly a year of labor behind the scenes, we have an announcement for you: Explained is finally back! And during this year, we’ve turned our attention to a crucial question: Why can’t we remember what is in the fridge? 

Or more importantly, why can’t we remember most of the details of our own lives? Why do an estimated 1 in 3 people suffer from an anxiety disorder at some point? And why, when we go to bed at night, are we overcome with strange visions? Do our dreams actually mean anything, or serve any purpose?

Our minds often feel like a black box. And the stakes of these questions go far beyond the fridge – to our fundamental sense of reality, and what it means to be human. How can we help ourselves, and each other, when our minds betray us? What can we do to take back some control? 

Scientists have figured out so much more than you might realize – and today, we’re diving deep, with 5 brand new episodes narrated by Emma Stone taking you on an adventure through the mind, available today.

Our weekly episodes return, as well, on September 26th. They’ll be right here – http://www.netflix.com/explained where Season 1 also awaits any of you who haven’t seen it yet.

Thanks so much to all of you who watch, support, and even teach the series. If you’re a teacher wondering if you can use the series: yes you can. Here’s Netflix’s policy: https://media.netflix.com/en/only-on-netflix/247606

You may think the greatest mysteries of the universe exist way out there, at the edge of a black hole. But they actually surround us all the time — and even sail right through our bodies. 

One such mystery is cosmic rays, radiation from space made of tiny bits of atoms. They’re not harmful to humans, but they’re perplexing physicists, who don’t know where they’re coming from. They’re super powerful — many are much too powerful to have originated from our sun or an exploding star. And because they don’t often travel in a straight line, it’s hard to pinpoint their true origin. 

This video is based on Vox science reporter Brian Resnick’s in-depth article about cosmic rays: https://www.vox.com/the-highlight/2019/7/16/17690740/cosmic-rays-universe-theory-science

Become a Video Lab member! http://bit.ly/video-lab

For centuries, the art world was controlled by the Academy of Fine Arts in Paris. They dictated how art should look and had the power to make or break an artist’s career. Getting into their yearly exhibition, the Paris Salon, was like an express pass to success. But in the late 1800s, artists started to push back against the Academy’s rules, which changed the landscape of the art world forever.

After prohibition — the total ban on alcohol — many states established a minimum legal drinking age of 21. But that began to change after the voting age was lowered to 18. Many states followed by lowering their drinking ages, which changed the landscape for the entire country.

By the 1980s, this unusual patchwork of drinking ages started to be seen as a problem, especially by activist organizations like MADD (Mothers Against Drunk Drivers) and RID (Remove Intoxicated Drivers). They lobbied for a 21-year-old minimum legal drinking age, and President Ronald Reagan supported the cause. His mechanism for enabling a national law? Threatening to withhold Federal Highway funding to states that didn’t comply.

It was an unpredictable strategy for an official typically hesitant to use federal power over the states, and the practice was eventually challenged in the Supreme Court, where it was upheld.

Beyond the political clash, it’s a look at how roads shape policy.

The Strait of Hormuz is a narrow waterway that lies between Iran and Oman. This 21 mile-wide passage supports 20% of the world’s oil supply. A closure of this waterway could send the global economy into a tailspin. 

In recent months, several oil tankers have been seized, attacked and harassed. These oil tankers — and this narrow water passage — are at the center of the conflict between the US and Iran. It's a conflict that spans decades and has the potential to escalate in one of the world’s most important oil chokepoints.

""Sicko Mode"" by Travis Scott was an unexpected chart-topper. It sounds more like three songs than one. Its disjointed, other-worldly effects, echos, and song structure are a far cry from the traditional pop songs we're used to, but it's in these off-kilter moments that we get glimpses of a musical culture and genre that was centered around sonic experimentation and innovation, and has influenced everything from punk, rock, and pop for nearly half a century: Jamaican dub.

Route 66 has gained a reputation as the United States of America’s most famous road. How did that happen, and why does it still matter?

In this episode of Vox Almanac, Vox’s Phil Edwards explores the history of the road and the textures of its present, from the road itself to the roadside attractions along the way, to the people who enjoy its diversions and those who help maintain them. It reveals a road that’s changed a lot over the decades but remains vital in unexpected ways.

When Cyrus Avery helped found Route 66 in the 1920s, he strived to create a road that would connect the Midwest to the West, and he resorted to promotional tricks and wheeling and dealing to get it done. The road quickly became a key route for migrants escaping the dust bowl and depression, forming its early reputation as “the Mother Road.”

That’s because it’s a road that’s more than a strip of concrete (or gravel, or dirt). It’s a historical document of everyone who’s traveled on it — as the many contributions from Vox’s YouTube subscribers show, that keeps it going even as the interstates run alongside it.

The number of Route 66 resources out there is huge, but we found these particularly helpful.

The American federal minimum wage hasn’t gone up in a decade. That’s the longest wait since the US first set a minimum wage in 1938. Today, Congress is debating whether they should raise it again. But the fact that Congress has to debate it at all is… kind of weird.

In the US, unlike in other developed countries, the minimum wage is a political issue. That means it gets raised irregularly and unpredictably. And that causes a bunch of problems for American workers and businesses.

But it doesn’t have to be that way.

It’s nearly impossible to turn on the radio and not hear a male artist singing really high. Likely he’s a tenor, and more often than not he’ll sing in falsetto. Think Justin Bieber, The Weeknd, Bruno Mars, Drake, Charlie Puth, Shawn Mendes, Adam Levine, Sam Smith ... the list goes on and on and on. 

This isn’t a trend — it has been the status quo for decades.

In this episode of Vox Almanac, Vox’s Phil Edwards investigates the system behind the shape of the suburbs.

If you’ve visited a suburb, you’ve probably noticed a similar look: same curving streets; same cul de sacs. It’s not an accident. In fact, this appearance of the suburbs is part of the Federal Housing Administration’s plan.

In the 1930s, the Federal Housing Administration, or FHA, was the financial engine behind most home development. To ensure their investments were safe ones, they strongly recommended that builders and developers comply with the ideals they set. Those regulations aligned closely with the values of the time, including segregation and a burgeoning car culture.

These rules encouraged suburbs with winding streets and cul de sacs — aesthetically pleasing designs that led to sprawl and made a car a necessity. Even though the enforcement mechanisms have changed over time, we still live in a culture shaped by the FHA’s ideal suburban design.

If you want to learn more, there are a couple of resources:

https://www.amazon.com/Streets-Shaping-Cities-Michael-Southworth/dp/1559639164
Eran Ben-Joseph spoke to me about his book, which provides a great overview of suburban planning. It also has more crucial detail about street widths, which influenced car culture.

In this episode of History Club, Vox’s Phil Edwards asks Coleman Lowndes a question: Was this American legend really as great as he was cracked up to be?

Davy Crockett’s become an American tall tale, but he was a real person and member of Congress. That’s where things get complicated. His incredible feats of bear-killing and frontier exploring intersected with a political career that was catalyzed by central banking.

When Crockett was alive, Andrew Jackson was president, and Jackson was embroiled in a battle over the Second Bank of the United States. That battle eventually resulted in the creation of a new political party — the Whigs — and the Whigs decided Crockett could help advance their cause.

In a strange way, it’s possible to trace the American icon and baby boomer fad back to this banking battle. And it says something about celebrity, politics, and how Americans imagine their history.

Student loan debt has increased exponentially in the past few decades. So now, some Democratic presidential candidates propose canceling those debts — all $1.6 trillion of it. But is this a good idea? Who exactly does it benefit?

In this episode of Vox Almanac’s Road Trip edition, Phil Edwards explores the history of the New York City grid, with detours to Philadelphia, Savannah, and Washington, DC. Early city planning around the turn of the 19th century was a contentious and undecided discipline with lots of options and disagreement.

New York City was particularly chaotic and unplanned at the time, after years of catering to developers and, at the same time, ignoring their requests for a more sane city plan. That made the introduction of a new plan in the 1800s a more urgent matter — and a reasonable time to introduce a plan that lacked many of the artistic flourishes of contemporary city plans. 

New York was all about building, and building fast — and it’s still that way today.

Want to learn more? The two most helpful papers we found were these: 
“The grid as city plan: New York city and laissez‐faire planning in the nineteenth century” by Peter Marcuse and “The Greatest Grid: the New York Plan of 1811” by Edward K. Spann. 

You can also find copies of a lot of early maps of New York via the Library of Congress and New York Public Library.

This video is presented by CuriosityStream: https://www.curiositystream.com/Vox

Become a Video Lab member! http://bit.ly/video-lab

The United States experiences more tornadoes than any other country, averaging over 1,200 per year. Most of those twisters are touching down in the central part of the country in an area called “Tornado Alley.” While the boundaries of this tornado hotbed are disputed, there’s no denying that something is going on here — and it all has to do with geography. 

The map we use in this video for Tornado Alley boundaries is from NOAA — you can find that and more information on their website: https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/climate-information/extreme-events/us-tornado-climatology/tornado-alley

Information on tornado averages and trends can also be found at NOAA:
https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/climate-information/extreme-events/us-tornado-climatology/trends

You may have noticed on our graphic around the one-minute mark that many of the Southeastern US states are prone to tornadoes as well. This is because they’re part of an area called “Dixie Alley.” The main difference between this area and Tornado Alley that tornadoes in Dixie Alley are more likely to touch down in the fall, while Tornado Alley experiences twisters in the early spring. This happens for the reasons outlined in the video above. This article offers a fairly compelling comparison of the two: 
http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.660.5241&rep=rep1&type=pdf

Finally, this video offered a simplified explanation of a really complex weather phenomenon. This National Geographic article does a really great job breaking it down again and also offers information on why it’s so hard to track and predict tornadoes:

In 1917, American health officials launched a campaign to use noxious, often toxic chemicals to delouse immigrants seeking to enter at the US-Mexico border. The same practice had caused a fire in an El Paso jail the year before and killed 27 people.

17-year-old Juárez maid Carmelita Torres refused to go through it, sparking a protest of thousands of Mexicans at the El Paso border. Although they briefly shut down the border, the campaign would continue for decades -- and go on to inspire Nazi scientists.

This is episode one of Vox Almanac’s new season all about roads — and this is a classic road trip to kick it off with. 

Thomas Edison, Henry Ford, Harvey Firestone, and John Burroughs became famous as “the Vagabonds” — a traveling group that took to the (primitive) roads to see the country and make the occasional business deal. Their exploits captured the imagination of the entire country, and it even involved a few naps.

Along the way, the unique foursome chopped trees, explored, and ate in style (while catering to the film crew they brought with them). The resulting output was a mix of PR and good old-fashioned fun. Even President Warren G. Harding joined along at one point just to see what the Vagabonds were up to.

The Tour de France is the most prominent cycling race in the world. It’s now in its 109th edition and it’s being called the ‘Highest in History’ because there are more climbs than ever before. This is important because the climbs are where the race is won and lost. The best riders rely on their teammates to get them through the long, flat, and hilly stages, before they take on the mountain stages on their own. These are the hardest and most brutal stages of the race - but they are exactly what makes the Tour de France famous.

India’s government has strict laws surrounding cow slaughter because cows are sacred in Hinduism. Prime Minister Narendra Modi emphasized the need to make sure India’s cows are protected and some state governments followed suit by opening more cow shelters and ordering more police crackdowns. But some took cow protection into their own hands. 

Cow vigilantes started patrolling neighborhoods looking to physically punish those who were allegedly harboring cows, consuming cows or even transporting cows. In most cases, the victims of these mob beatings were Muslim. 

This Vox Borders episode looks at why violence over cows increased since India’s elections in 2014.

This court has stopped many of Trump’s most controversial executive orders: the travel ban, emergency funding for a border wall. But this historically liberal court won’t look very liberal at the end of Trump’s first term.

Bedfords were first introduced to British India during World War II. This truck model and others similar to it stuck around, and since then they've been produced commercially throughout the country. But today, they’re not just functional and mundane — their paintings make them stand out.

Colorful trucks aren’t rare in India, and their designs aren’t random. Artists that specialize in painting these trucks put a lot of thought into the art form, making the vehicles a spectacle of beauty in India.

This Vox Borders episode looks at why truck art is such a staple in India.

Become a Video Lab member! http://bit.ly/video-lab

House has become one of the most popular forms of electronic music since its inception in the late 80’s.

It began in Chicago, when local DJ’s and music producers experimented with remixing disco vocals over hard hitting drum machines. They would soon play a huge role in popularizing the sound and distinguishing house music as a global music genre. 

Chicago gospel singer, Loleatta Halloway, is one of the most widely sampled artists in house music history. Her song “Love Sensation” has been sampled nearly 300 times, including on Black Box’s “Ride on Time”, the notorious hit that became the best selling single in the U.K in 1989.

Fishing is the economic lifeline for villages in northern Sri Lanka. But after a decades long civil war, fishermen returned to find their fish stocks depleted – and they pointed the finger squarely at neighboring India. 

As Indian fishermen developed methods to increase hauls, and crossed a maritime border that was more permeable during the war, they depleted the fish stock for both sides. 

Now, the Sri Lankan Navy is retaliating with force, only making the relationship between the two communities that rely on these waters worse. 

This Vox Borders episode will look at how the drawing of a maritime border and lack of access to fish caused a conflict between two communities that used to live in harmony.

Elections in India aren’t like others. India voted to pick its central government for the next five years throughout the spring of 2019. An eighth of the world’s entire population was eligible to vote in this election. That’s 900 million people, and more than 67 percent voted.

India runs the world’s biggest elections, and officials put in a lot of effort to make this democratic exercise is as accessible as possible. This means they make sure everyone, even in the most remote locations, is near a polling booth — even if it means bringing voting machines to them by elephant.

This Vox Borders episode looks at how India pulls off massive elections.

_c7AuSQdvow,Vox,UCLXo7UDZvByw2ixzpQCufnA,Why Iraq's great rivers are dying,2019-07-02 12:00:05+00:00,"And the timing couldn't be worse.

Become a Video Lab member! http://bit.ly/video-lab

Iraq gets almost all of its water from two rivers: The Tigris and the Euphrates. Both begin in Turkey and make their way down the entire length of the country, before emptying into the Persian Gulf. The problem is - they are drying up.

There are two main reasons for this. The first is geographical: Since both rivers begin in Turkey, Iraq doesn’t have control of how much water it receives. In the last 30 years, Turkey, Syria, and Iran have been building hundreds of dams along both rivers. Now only a quarter of the Euphrates reaches Iraq. Secondly, Iraq has been stuck in conflict for the last 16 years. In each case, the delicate network of treatment plants, dams, canals, and pipes has been repeatedly destroyed and neglected.

All of this has boiled over in the city of Basra - at Iraq’s southern tip. Last summer, after hundreds were poisoned by the water - riots erupted and were deeply destabilizing for the new Iraqi government. If Iraq is to rebuild, it needs to get fresh water to its people - a challenge that is getting harder every year.

Try Dashlane free here: http://www.dashlane.com/vox – Get 10% off now with my promo code: VOX

This spring, the Court of Arbitration for Sport upheld rules imposed by the International Association of Athletic Federations (IAAF) limiting the participation of female athletes with high levels of testosterone. On the other side of the decision was Caster Semenya: a South African runner who has repeatedly been penalized by sports officials throughout her career. The IAAF has gone through many iterations of their female regulations throughout the past decade, and Caster Semenya has been targeted with each successive policy. Most recently, the regulation has been a testosterone limit of five nanomoles per liter. 

Throughout the past decade, the media has been following Semenya's story closely and shaping a narrative that is often misguided or inaccurate. In this video we piece together the underlying issues relevant to sex testing in sports and contextualize them within the long history of scrutinizing female athletes. By covering the controversy surrounding 2016 women’s 800 meters Olympic gold medalist Caster Semenya, along with historical events concerning Polish sprinter Ewa Klobukowska and Indian sprinter Dutee Chand, the goal is to help explain how athletic officials have repeatedly failed in their attempt to establish definitive sex testing regulations for female competitors.

The 1900 US Federal Census revealed that 1.75 million children under the age of 16, more than one in five, were gainfully employed. They worked all over the country in cotton mills, glass blowing factories, sardine canneries, farms, and even coal mines. In an effort to expose this exploitation of children, the National Child Labor Committee hired a photographer to travel around the country and investigate and report on the labor conditions of children. 

Lewis Wickes Hine photographed and interviewed kids, some as young as 4 years old, and published his findings in various Progressive magazines and newspapers. Once the public saw the plight of these children, state legislatures were pressured to pass bills regulating labor for workers under the age of 18, effectively bringing an end to child labor in the United States.

Most fish die the same way — slow suffocation in the open air. It’s easy for fishers, but it causes fish tons of stress, and floods their bodies with chemicals like cortisol, adrenaline, and lactic acid. Those chemicals make the fish taste bad, smell “fishy,” and rot quickly. 

But there's a better way: a four-step Japanese method called ikejime. It involves sharp knives. And a brain spike. 

We adapted this video from Vox’s Future Perfect podcast, which goes much more in depth on ikejime: https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2018/11/14/18091698/future-perfect-podcast-killing-fish-ikejime-animal-welfare

The video conferencing session between the two schools was conducted between students of Gyan Mandir Public School (Delhi, India) and Adamjee Model School (Karachi, Pakistan). The session was coordinated by Ms Anju Anand and Ms Devika Mittal from Indian side and Mr Usama Palla and Ms Suraya Islam from Pakistan. We're grateful they let us drop by!

The British tasked Cyril Radcliffe with the job of drawing a line to separate Punjab and Bengal provinces from India into East and West Pakistan. Muslims and Hindus weren’t the only ones being separated from each other. Sikhs and people from other faiths were affected as well. 

A Sikh pilgrimage was divided because of the new border, Punjabi people of all faiths were separated from each other, and a culture was ultimately divided.

This Vox Borders episode looks at how the Radcliffe line changed Punjab and how communities are affected now.

Correction at 7:48: The protester says “They are not doing this for themselves, but for the future of Hong Kong.”

Hundreds of thousands of Hongkongers have taken to the streets to protest a controversial extradition bill that could send Hong Kong residents to mainland China to be tried in court. Hong Kong’s Chief Executive, Carrie Lam, says the bill is meant to prevent Hong Kong from becoming a safe haven for fugitives. But its opponents fear that Hong Kong would be exposed to China’s flawed judicial system, which would lead to further erasure of the city’s judicial independence.

At first Lam was determined to move forward with the bill. But after a series of massive protests, she announced she would “indefinitely suspend” the bill. But protesters aren't accepting the suspension, and have started demanding its complete withdrawal. They've also begun calling for Lam’s resignation.

But this rise in tensions is about a lot more than a bill. To understand why this bill hits a nerve with Hongkongers, it's important to understand Hong Kong’s relationship with China - and exactly how the bill would tip the scales in China’s favor.

Help our reporting on hidden histories. Submit a story idea here: http://bit.ly/2RhjxMy

Correction at 7:23: Cynthia's ancestors lived in Wilmington, not her descendants.

In November 1898, in Wilmington, North Carolina, a mob of 2,000 white men expelled black and white political leaders, destroyed the property of the city’s black residents, and killed dozens--if not hundreds--of people. How did such a turn of events change the course of the city? For decades, the story of this violence was buried, while the perpetrators were cast as heroes. Yet its impacts resonate across the state to this day.

In the new Vox series Missing Chapter, Vox Senior Producer Ranjani Chakraborty revisits underreported and often overlooked moments from the past to give context to the present. Join her as she covers the histories that are often left out of our textbooks. Our first season tackles stories of racial injustice, political conflicts, even the hidden history of US medical experimentation.

Astronauts landed on the moon for the first time 50 years ago, and they left a bunch of stuff up there — including their poop. Scientists want to know: Is there anything alive in there? 

Our poop is over 50 percent bacteria, and we don’t know if any of that bacteria can survive in the moon’s inhospitable environment. But if we go back to check it out, that poop could answer some big scientific questions — including how life started in the broader universe.

The US Senate is supposed to pass laws. But today, it’s broken. And it’s broken because of something called the filibuster, which has been part of Senate tradition for over 200 years. But the filibuster came into being by accident. And today, some politicians are suggesting we should get rid of it entirely.

Become a Video Lab member! http://bit.ly/video-lab

The Green New Deal is an ambitious plan to fight the effects of climate change. It’s the only American plan that actually acknowledges the size of the impending crisis. And it contains some difficult truths that we might not want to hear.

Read the Green New Deal resolution here: https://ocasio-cortez.house.gov/sites/ocasio-cortez.house.gov/files/Resolution%20on%20a%20Green%20New%20Deal.pdf

For additional context I recommend this piece by Vox’s Umair Irfan on the United Nations climate report, where the world’s best climatologists tell us how urgent of a problem this is: https://www.vox.com/2018/10/8/17948832/climate-change-global-warming-un-ipcc-report

This piece from Vox’s David Roberts, shows that world leaders really aren’t taking this urgency seriously. https://www.vox.com/2016/10/4/13118594/2-degrees-no-more-fossil-fuels

Finally, you should read this explainer of the Green New Deal, followed by this story (in list form) by Hannah Northey:

Join the Video Lab! http://bit.ly/video-lab

Staten Island recently received funding for a nearly 5-mile-long seawall to protect its coast. But the plan raises a lot of questions. We’re living in a dangerously dynamic world: Hurricanes are getting worse, wildfires are rampant in California, extreme heat is melting roads in India, and sea levels continue to rise. Will a wall really be enough to protect our coastal cities?

Alissa Walker from Curbed talked to us about how it’s too late to stop the changing climate, but not too late to change how we think about infrastructure.

Join the Video Lab! http://bit.ly/video-lab

We’re letting foods we’ve eaten for thousands of years disappear from farmers’ fields, and from our plates. Saving them isn’t just a matter of cultural preservation. In the next 30 years, we’re going to need to learn how to feed more people on a hotter planet, and the more genetic varieties we lose, the harder it’ll be to adapt. 

To learn more about the foods facing extinction in the US and around the world, check out the Ark of Taste, a project of Slow Food USA.

Journalist Mark Shapiro’s book, Seeds of Resistance, goes into much more detail about the risk that genetic homogeneity poses to our food supply. He also profiles some of the efforts, many led by indigenous communities, to preserve older seed varieties. 

For more on seed relabeling, check out the Farmers Business Network’s 2018 Seed Relabeling Report.

The chart on declining global yields for corn, wheat, and rice comes from an article in the academic journal Disasters and Climate Change Economics from agricultural economists Mekbib G. Haile, Tesfamicheal Wossen, Kindie Tesfaye, and Joachim von Braun. Their prediction model takes into account both climate change and price volatility, which is why their estimates are higher than those of some other researchers.

Join the Video Lab! http://bit.ly/video-lab

The Cuban Missile Crisis was the closest the world has ever come to all-out nuclear war, and it all started with a photo. 

On October 15th, 1962, Dino Brugioni, a senior analyst at the newly-formed National Photographic Interpretation Center, identified missile trailers measuring approximately 65 feet in an aerial reconnaissance photo. Those trailers were a match for the Soviet SS-4, a medium-range ballistic missile with a range that would cover a huge amount of the United States, including Washington, DC. 

Upon seeing this photo, US President John F. Kennedy ordered more aerial recon flights, conducted by the CIA using the high-altitude U-2 spy plane. He used these photographs to make a plan of action about confronting the Soviet Union over their secretive installation of offensive missiles in Cuba.

We tend to assume that if a story is being covered by major news networks, it’s because journalists have decided that the story is important. But thanks to Fox News, that’s not always true. 

The network was specifically created to generate scandals that would hurt Democrats and help Republicans. And because most major networks pay attention to what happens in conservative media, those pseudoscandals end up creeping into mainstream coverage. 

The result is a media ecosystem that advantages Republicans by paying disproportionate attention to right-wing talking points.

Allergy season is upon us once again. And if it seems like your allergies are getting worse year after year, it’s not just your imagination. 

Pollen is a fine powder produced as part of the sexual reproductive cycle of many varieties of plants. As climate change warms the planet, pollen production is ramping up. And that’s becoming a problem, whether you suffer from seasonal allergies — or not.

Prescription drugs cost more in the United States than anywhere else in the world. One big reason why is America’s particular system for how drugs get to patients, which is unlike almost any other country’s. But it’s also because the American prescription drug market is so profitable that the money it generates powers the entire global pharmaceutical industry.

Sansa Stark and Cersei Lannister are two of Game of Thrones’ most recognizable enemies. But despite being on opposite sides of Westeros, their costumes have a ton in common.

From the very beginning of the show, their outfits have been mirrors. When they’re both oppressed and weak in the earlier seasons, they’re dressed in loose, pastel clothing signaling their lack of power. As the show moves on and their plots become more complicated, they don “survival camouflage,” clothes used to mask secrets and blend in with enemies. And when both women begin to assert the power of their houses, Lannister lions and Stark wolves become the focal point of their clothes.

In the show’s final season, Sansa and Cersei default to military-style accents on their gowns as they prep for battle. Those high-necked dresses evoke images of each family’s armor — full of defensive details like epaulets and draped chains. And while both leaders have learned different lessons about war and family, it’s safe to say their outfit parallels are there for a reason.

Join the Video Lab! http://bit.ly/video-lab

Mary Shelley’s Frankenstein has been reimagined onscreen hundreds of times and is a staple of pop culture. The prevailing takeaway is science-gone-wrong and the dangers of pursuing the unnatural. But contemporary readers, surrounded by Enlightenment-era scientific breakthroughs that were beginning to shift the definition of death, would have read the story as frighteningly plausible. 

Electricity was being used in a scientific practice called “galvanism,” which seemed to show some promise in reanimating body parts of recently dead animals and humans. Shelley even references galvanism in the 1831 edition of the book, citing it as an example of how this experiment could be a possibility.

China has been quietly detaining its population of Uighurs, the country’s Muslim minority, in internment camps. First-hand accounts from inside the camps paint a brutal picture of torture and political indoctrination. At first, China denied the existence of these camps and tried to cover them up. But as a network of academics and activists uncovered evidence of the camps' locations, and the reality of what’s going on inside, China changed its story.

New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo recently announced a plan to bring congestion pricing to New York City. The goal is to raise money for the city’s crumbling public transit system and reclaim the dangerously busy city streets.

We took a look at London, a city that enacted a congestion charge in 2003, to see some of the benefits. Check out the video above to learn more.

“When it premiered, “Cops” was one of the first reality television shows and it has been broadcasting continuously since 1989. In this video, we worked with the podcast “Running From Cops” to understand why the show has stayed on TV for so long. At the time it was selected for development by Fox executive Stephen Chao, the writer’s strike of 1988 had created a desire for unscripted television that didn’t require hiring union talent. 

But once “Cops” was on the air, it was the vision of “Cops” creator John Langley that would make the show last. He understood that the show presented a new opportunity for law enforcement agencies and it was his approach to making “Cops” that has kept police interested in appearing on the show. While “Cops” no longer has the high TV ratings it garnered during the nineties, it has been a persistent presence on television and it has spawned several imitators, including the very popular show “Live PD”. 

Like “Cops”, these shows use variations of a reality format developed by “Cops” that features police performing their daily duties. The stripped-down format has remained nearly the same since the show began in 1989 and during the thirty years since “Cops” has had the same agreement with police that agree to appear on the reality show. 

To learn what that agreement is, make sure to watch the video above.

To learn even more about “Cops”, make sure to listen to “Running From Cops”: a podcast that investigates various aspects of “Cops” and examines its cultural impact on policing on America.

Read more about the movement behind the Lake Erie Bill of Rights: https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2019/2/26/18241904/lake-erie-legal-rights-personhood-nature-environment-toledo-ohio

The Lake Erie Bill of Rights is the first law of its kind in the United States. In February of 2019, the residents of Toledo, Ohio voted to give Lake Erie's entire ecosystem legal rights. That means any citizen of Toledo, if they have credible evidence that a corporation or government is harming the lake, can file a lawsuit on behalf of Lake Erie in court. 

The Lake Erie Bill of Rights is part of a larger movement to give legal rights to mountains, rivers, forests, and other natural objects. The citizens of these communities -- from Pennsylvania, to Ecuador, to New Zealand -- argue that because their long-term survival is dependent on the health of their natural surroundings, anything that harms the lakes, rivers, or forests they depend on should be considered a legal harm. 

It’s a totally new way of approaching the law, and it could change the very nature of our relationship with the natural world. This is how one community in Ohio started what they hope will be a nationwide movement.

In the early 1970s, a musical sensation took over New York City. It was called Disco. Before Disco became synonymous with Saturday Night Fever, Rod Stewart, and celebrity-fueled parties, it was an underground movement powered by the innovations of young DJs challenging themselves and each other to throw the city’s most adventurous dance parties. 

By 1973, their influence as musical taste makers became apparent, and a handful of unconventional dance tracks became pop crossover hits. With barely any radio airplay, songs like ""Love Theme"" and ""Girl You Need a Change of Mind"" became defining tracks of the disco era. 

These songs were repetitive, hypnotic, and funky, and they were also pretty long compared to other pop hits. That presented a problem for DJs using 7-inch 45rpm singles, which fit only 3:30 minutes of quality audio on them, during their night-long sets. They needed a vinyl record that could make their most popular tracks sound powerful on a dance floor and last the whole night. 

In 1976, an accidental studio discovery by Disco pioneer Tom Moulton provided the solution: A 12-inch single. By stretching one song across 12 inches of vinyl, a format typically reserved for full-length albums, those extended dance tracks had room to breath. 

By the 1980s, the 12-inch single dominated pop music. It not only changed the sound of records, it allowed for music producers to experiment with length and structure.

In this episode of Vox Almanac, Vox’s Phil Edwards explores the poop-filled history of the Canada goose — and the way people transformed it from migratory wonder to public nuisance.

If you’ve played on a soccer field or strolled past a golf course in the United States, you’ve doubtless seen gaggles of Canada geese terrorizing the public space. These geese were actually put here by state agencies in the 1960s, '70s, and '80s as part of public programs to create Canada goose populations after nearly hunting the bird to extinction. Because these birds are all protected by the Migratory Bird Treaty Act, it proves surprisingly difficult to get the geese to leave.

There are some methods of geese removal, like egg oiling, or addling, that stop new geese from hatching. It’s a lot of effort, but it works. Still, these Canada geese illustrate some of the unintended consequences that happened when people tried to foster flocks in the last half-century.

Become a Video Lab member! http://bit.ly/video-lab

People usually associate the birth of photography with Louis Daguerre’s Daguerreotype. His process became the first widespread method of photography after France revealed it to the world on August 19, 1839. But there were actually multiple inventors of photography, and one of them was an amateur French tinkerer named Hippolyte Bayard. Even before Daguerre’s process was revealed, Bayard had achieved photographic results. 

However, François Arago, the chair of the French Academy of Sciences, overlooked Bayard’s accomplishment and elevated Daguerre’s instead. And as a protest to this perceived injustice, Bayard took a self-portrait depicting himself as an unidentified man in the Paris Morgue who took his own life. This image is not only the first staged photo, it’s also an early example of photography depicting something non-literal and symbolic, laying the groundwork for the medium to be used as a form of creative expression. 

Bayard's photographs at the French Society of Photography:

Measles is back in the United States, and to understand why, you have to understand where.

When anti-vaccination misinformation leads to a drop in the number of children immunized, a community can lose its “herd immunity.” This happens most often in small, tight-knit communities, in which measles can spread like wildfire. 75% of all recent measles cases have happened in those types of communities.

In order for everyone to be protected from measles, all people who can get vaccinated need to. But most states allow parents to opt out of vaccinating their children for any philosophical reason - and that’s allowing measles to make a comeback.

At-home DNA ancestry tests have become hugely popular in recent years. More than 26 million have taken one of these tests. If their marketing is to be believed, they can help you learn where your DNA comes from, and even where your ancestors lived. 

But the information that can be inferred from your DNA is actually much more limited than testing companies are letting on. And that has lead consumers to misinterpret their results — which is having negative consequences.

5v13wrVEQ2M,Vox,UCLXo7UDZvByw2ixzpQCufnA,How Norway designed a more humane prison,2019-04-12 12:00:02+00:00,"There’s a better way to design prison architecture.

Become a Video Lab member! http://bit.ly/video-lab

Halden Prison in Norway looks sort of like a fancy dorm room or a hotel — much different than the barbed wire and cramped cells we often associate with prison design. Its look is all part of a plan to create a more humane prison, one where the architecture isn’t part of the punishment. 

Most prisons around the world are consolidated into one single building. This style makes it easy and efficient for inmates to move around, but the design is monotonous and full of visually unappealing materials, like steel and concrete. Plus, tight quarters inside these spaces can foster conflict. 

Halden has a different structure: a campus design, where inmates move from one building to another, and are surrounded by lots of windows and construction materials that help muffle noise and take advantage of natural light.  

The prison’s layout also encourages guards to interact with inmates face-to-face, which fosters better relationships and reduces security-related incidents. 

Halden’s design style is expensive — which is why we mostly see it implemented in places with good social support systems, like Western Europe and Scandinavia. Still, the design is setting new standards for what prisons could be like in the future. 

By Design is a new Vox video series about the intersection of design and technology, hosted by Christophe Haubursin.

Join the Video Lab to see Phil's Q&A! http://bit.ly/video-lab

Leonardo da Vinci’s known for his art and inventions — but also his groundbreaking maps, like this one of Imola, Italy. In this episode of Vox Almanac, Vox’s Phil Edwards explores how it was made.

Further reading: 

1) John Pinto’s History of the Ichnographic City Plan is useful to understand the history of these maps.
2) Check out Portraying the City in Early Modern Europe: Measurement, Representation, and Planning by Hilary Ballon and David Friedman for more info.
3) If you want to dig deeper into early maps, Jessica Maier’s Mapping Past and Present: Leonardo Bufalini’s Plan of Rome is fascinating.

Please email Phil if you have trouble finding any of these papers.

Drafting 1502’s equivalent to a “satellite” map was a massive undertaking, and Leonardo managed to pull it off. His early map helped Italian politcian Cesare Borgia construct an idea of the town of Imola that was far more accurate than most contemporary maps. Through the use of careful measurements of angles and pacing out distances using a primitive odometer, Leonardo managed to create a map that was very close to accurate.

This map — an “ichnographic” map — was a step forward in portraying how maps could work to represent geography. Though it’s marked with some inaccuracies, it’s stunningly precise for the time and pushed forward the art of mapmaking. Leonardo’s Imola remains, even today, a remarkably useful guide to the city.

In Vox Almanac, Senior Producer Phil Edwards explains the world through history's footnotes.

Become a Video Lab member! http://bit.ly/video-lab

This is an updated version of a video we published in 2016 about the Event Horizon Telescope, an international collaboration to image a black hole for the first time in human history. 

On April 10, 2019, the team announced their results: They had successfully imaged the supermassive black hole in the center of the galaxy m87, which is nearly 54 million light-years away from us. They were able to achieve unprecedented resolution using very long baseline interferometry, which combines the observations of multiple radio telescopes across the globe. 

The team wanted to find out whether Einstein's Theory of General Relativity holds up in the extreme environment of black holes, and the results do, in fact, seem to be consistent with the predictions. In the future, we may see more and shaper images of black holes as the team targets smaller wavelengths of light and recruits more telescopes. Eventually, they may include an orbiting space telescope.

Become a Video Lab member! http://bit.ly/video-lab

The explicit lyrics sticker is one of the most recognizable images in American music. Its placement on an album cover signifies you’re going to hear something for adult ears only, and it’s an image we often take for granted. The story behind how we got that sticker is bonkers, to say the least. 

The very public discussion around the advisory label involved the Parents Music Resource Center (PMRC), a group led by the wives of Washington politicians and a few musicians including Frank Zappa, Dee Snider, and John Denver.

While the PMRC’s involvement was allegedly sparked by some raunchy lyrics from Prince’s 1984 album Purple Rain, the debate over rock lyrics had been infiltrating American culture and politics for a decade. The driving force behind that debate was the rise of heavy metal, a genre that saw explosive popularity with the launch of MTV in 1981, and the growing influence of the religious right, who saw rock music as a powerful threat to Christianity.

Subscribe to our channel! http://goo.gl/0bsAjO

Tucker Carlson has branded himself as a populist, condemning the “liberal elite” that he argues makes up the American “ruling class.” It’s a good shtick, and it’s helped him stand out from other Fox News hosts. But while Tucker decries the “elite” on his show, he regularly ignores major stories of Republican economic policies that harm the working class, choosing instead to focus on bogus culture war stories.

That isn’t an accident. Carlson’s show is meant to distract Fox News viewers from Republican economics, channeling their frustration and anger at groups that don’t deserve it. That kind of misdirection produces what Marxist theorists call “false consciousness”: when workers are tricked into accepting their own exploitation.

In this pilot episode of History Club, Vox’s Phil Edwards and Coleman Lowndes discuss the incredible Gilbreth story, with all its twists and turns. 

The Gilbreth family became famous in the film ""Cheaper By The Dozen"" but they were far more interesting than the most recent incarnation. Though the 1950 movie came closer to the truth, the real Gilbreths were pioneers in home life and the business world.

Frank and Lillian Gilbreth were equal partners in their unique business of time efficiency. Frank Gilbreth brought a construction background, while Lillian was the psychological half. Together, their time and motion studies mixed analysis and psychology in a seamless fashion.

Later on, Lillian led their business alone — and her pivot to home life has a clear connection to the life hack culture we live in today.

When paleontologists uncover a dinosaur they usually only find part of the animal, but when we walk through a museum we see exhibits that paint a full picture – so how do they fill in all those blank spaces? In the early 1900’s artists used to hand carve the pieces, but we’ve come a long way in the past century  – both technologically and scientifically. 

Now, we’re living in what some call a “golden age” for paleontology. Researchers are uncovering nearly one new species of dinosaur a week – making building exhibits easier and more efficient.

4dgzJQsAXfI,Vox,UCLXo7UDZvByw2ixzpQCufnA,Why baby cages were a thing,2019-03-28 12:00:00+00:00,"Yep, they hung above traffic. And there was a reason.

Join the Video Lab! http://bit.ly/video-lab

In this episode of Vox Almanac, Vox’s Phil Edwards explores the bold and beautiful baby cage.

Yes, hanging baby cages were a minor fad in the early 20th century. Why? A couple of reasons are listed in one baby cage patent, and they give us insight into the culture of the time.

First, urbanization in the United States and England made people want to recapture some of the country life they were missing. Baby cages were one way to do that, giving babies “fresh air” without taking them out of the city.

As importantly, tuberculosis treatments involving fresh air made it a common treatment for a wider variety of ailments. People sought ways to sleep outdoors as much as possible so, when it came to babies, it makes sense that they wanted the best for their little tykes.

So are baby cages a good idea? Probably not — but they are an understandable one.

In Vox Almanac, Senior Producer Phil Edwards explains the world through history's footnotes.

A foreign accent is when someone speaks a second language with the rules of their first language, and one of the most persistent and well-studied foreign-accent features is a lack of L/R contrast among native Japanese speakers learning English. 

It’s so well-known that American soldiers in World War II reportedly used codewords like “lallapalooza” to distinguish Japanese spies from Chinese allies. But American movies and TV shows have applied this linguistic stereotype to Korean and Chinese characters too, like Kim Jong Il in Team America: World Police, or Chinese restaurant employees singing “fa ra ra ra ra” in A Christmas Story. 

However, Japanese, Korean, and Chinese  are completely different languages that each handle L-sound and R-sounds differently. In this episode of Vox Observatory, we take a look at each language and how it affects pronunciation for English-language learners.

For nearly 200 years, India was ruled by the British. The large nation was home to three dominant religious groups — Hindus, Muslims and Sikhs. In order to discourage unified Indian campaigns for independence, the British reinforced divisions along religious lines. 

By 1947, the British were finally ready to turn India over to Indian rule. But the seeds of discontent had been sowed. And the handover of power would be more bloody than anyone could have imagined.

Become a Video Lab member! http://bit.ly/video-lab

The dispute between India and Pakistan over Kashmir is one of the longest running conflicts. Ever since Britain left India in 1947 and hastily drew borders demarcating a Hindu-majority India and a Muslim-majority Pakistan, Kashmir, located right between the two, has been fervently claimed by both nations.  

India and Pakistan’s first war was fought over Kashmir’s status as the the newly independent countries were being formed. After over a year of bloody conflict the UN stepped in and brokered a ceasefire that drew a line down the middle of Kashmir and gave a portion of the territory to India and the remainder to Pakistan. This arrangement was meant to be temporary. Once the violence settled a vote was to be held that would allow Kashmiris to decide their own future. 

But more than 70 years later, Kashmiris have yet to vote on their status. They remain stuck between two nuclear nations locked in a dangerous conflict with no end in sight.

Étienne-Jules Marey was a French scientist and inventor who analyzed how things moved. He developed a way to photograph multiple stages of movement onto a single glass plate, a technique called chronophotography. Later, when Kodak introduced celluloid film, Marey swapped the glass plate for a roll of film that moved in between exposures. This technique formed the basis of cinematography, and it’s how he recorded the stages of a cat righting itself in midair. He published his findings in Nature and demonstrated how the cat splits its body in two and uses the inertia of its own body weight to spin around.

These days, pro golfers are hitting the ball far. Really far. And it's creating a problem: because modern golfers can reach the hole with fewer shots than before, older courses -- like Augusta National Golf Club, Oakmont Country Club, and others -- are becoming obsolete. Now, professional organizations, like the United States Golf Association, are struggling to find a solution for big powerful golfers like Dustin Johnson, Bubba Watson, and Tiger Woods. While the jump in distance is due to lots of factors, conversation is centering on the controversial possibility of redesigning the golf ball to reduce distance. It'd be the latest turn in the ball's long history: Golf balls have evolved from ""featheries,"" to gutties, to balata balls, and eventually dimpled modern balls. But the biggest, and most recent change? The almost-instantaneous switch from wound balls to solid core multilayer balls like the Titleist Pro V1.

In 2018, about 25% of items that Americans tried to recycle were actually non-recyclable trash, known as ""contamination."" The more contamination that enters recycling plants, the more likely a waste management company will simply send the entire haul, including items that could be recycled, to a landfill.

The Green New Deal is an ambitious proposal that outlines how the U.S. might begin transitioning towards a green economy over the next ten years. It includes steps like upgrading our power grid and renovating our transportation infrastructure. But most people watching news coverage likely don’t know what’s in the Green New Deal. And that’s because political news coverage tends to focus on strategy over substance, fixating on a bill’s political ramifications rather than its ability to solve a problem. That approach to news coverage is known as “tactical framing,” and research shows it makes audiences at home more cynical and less informed about big policy debates. The result is a cycle of partisanship, where solutions to big problems like climate change are judged on their political popularity rather than their merit.

An astounding amount of American wealth lies with very few ultrarich people. But it isn’t taxed by the federal government. That's because most of the taxes we pay only happen when money changes hands — when we earn it or spend it. 

This is what a recent proposal from Senator Elizabeth Warren tries to fix. Her plan is to tax fortunes greater than $50 million at 2 percent each year, and wealth greater than $1 billion at 3 percent. When you add it all up, those tiny slivers of massive fortunes would raise enough revenue to pay for huge programs for everyone else.

In 2016 researchers released a study with an incredible headline: monkey vocal tracts are speech-ready. It showed that monkeys are held back from speech not by their bodies, but by their brains. But if that’s the case, what’s the deal with birds?

Parrots are known for their ability to mimic human speech with incredible accuracy. It’s jarring to hear an animal so vastly different from us speaking our language. So how do they do it? Partially, neurology: parrots are wired for communication in ways other animals (including other birds) are not. But it’s largely physiology. Birds are uniquely equipped to make sounds, and this video will give you a basic overview of how that works.

Throughout reporting this piece I had several conversations with Dr. Irene Pepperberg – If you’re interested in the neurology of these birds, I highly recommend checking out her studies on African Grey parrots. I’ve linked to a few of them below:

Evidence for Conceptual Quantitative Abilities in the African Grey Parrot: Labeling of Cardinal Sets

Special thanks to David Fowler, who generously allowed us to use his drawing of the plan of the Hindenburg (00:13 of the video). See more of his work here: http://www.highriskadventures.com/airships/

In May 1937, the airship Hindenburg burned up while approaching Lakehurst, New Jersey, on its first flight to the US that year. A flying symbol of pride for Nazi Germany, the Hindenburg was the biggest and most elaborate zeppelin ever built. At a time when airplanes were only carrying one or two people across the Atlantic Ocean, the Hindenburg was flying paid passengers, who enjoyed its dining room, reading room, passenger lounge, and even smoking room. It was an iconic luxury vessel, but it was filled with hydrogen, a flammable gas. And when it rushed its landing in New Jersey, it ended up exploding in front of a waiting group of newsreel cameras and becoming the first aviation disaster filmed as it was taking place. Sam Shere’s photo of the moment just before the ship was entirely engulfed is now an iconic snapshot that manages to perfectly frame the entire disaster.

Help our reporting on hidden histories. Submit a story idea here: http://bit.ly/2RhjxMy

100 years ago, a white mob destroyed an American neighborhood called “Black Wall Street,” murdering an estimated 300 people in Tulsa, Oklahoma. That incident — known as the 1921 Tulsa Race Massacre — has been largely left out of US history books. Today, a century later, the city still has a lot of questions. For one, where are the bodies of the victims? As the city's mayor re-opens the search for mass graves, we take a look at what happened back in 1921…and why finding these graves still matters to the people of Tulsa.

This video is presented by Brilliant: https://brilliant.org/vox

Correction: At 1:04, we mistakenly suggested that rayon is made from plastic. In fact, it is derived from cellulose.

When you think of marine pollution, you might picture an oil-slicked seal struggling to breathe on a blackened beach, or a turtle looping in circles with the plastic collar of a six-pack wrapped around its neck. In the past, those powerful images have generated interest and resources for fighting marine pollution, but now a new, much tinier threat is emerging.

Microplastics — meaning any plastic object smaller than five millimeters — constitute the vast majority of plastic particles polluting marine habitats. 

Of those microplastics, a large share are microfibers: tiny strands of plastic that are woven into fabric used to make clothing. These fabrics, known by names like polyester and nylon, are cheap to produce, comfortable to wear, and since arriving on the market in the late 1940s, companies have been using more and more of them. Every time we do laundry, a small amount of microfibers are separated from clothes made from these materials. Since those pieces of plastic are extremely small, they're able to make their way through water treatment centers and into marine resources. Once they reach marine habitats, the ocean’s tiniest creatures consume them, and microfibers work their way up the food chain. Eventually, they reach us.

In this episode of Vox Almanac, Vox’s Phil Edwards explores the big @!#*$ deal with using symbols for curses.

Known as the “grawlix” — a term invented by Beetle Bailey cartoonist Mort Walker — this string of symbols is almost as old as comics, extending back to the early 1900s. Comics like The Katzenjammer Kids and Lady Bountiful were truly inventing the art form and, in the process, had to figure out a way to show obscenities to kids. Enter #*@!$ like this. The grawlix performs a censorship function while, at the same time, revealing that something naughty is going on.

This video is presented by Wix, sign up at https://www.wix.com/go/vox

The stereotypical modern playground — with its bright colors and rubberized flooring — is designed to be clean, safe, and lawsuit-proof. But that isn't necessarily the best design for kids.

US playground designers spent decades figuring out how to minimize risk: reducing heights, softening surfaces, and limiting loose parts. But now, some are experimenting with creating risk. A growing body of research has found that risky outdoor play is a key part of children’s health, promoting social interactions, creativity, problem-solving, and resilience. 

Some communities are even experimenting with “adventure playgrounds,” a format with origins in World War II Denmark, where bomb sites became impromptu playgrounds. Filled with props like nails, hammers, saws, paint, tires, and wood planks, these spaces look more like junkyards than play spaces — and parents are often kept outside of the playground while children are chaperoned by staff. Now, that question of keeping children safe versus keeping children engaged is at the heart of a big debate in playground design.

Subscribe to our channel! http://goo.gl/0bsAjO

The U.S. government has experienced three major shutdowns over the past twenty-five years. In 1995, it was a fight over programs like Medicare. In 2013, it was over an effort to defund Obamacare. In 2018, it was over funding for a border wall. And while each crisis revolved around a different policy fight, they all followed a similar pattern: Republicans, egged on by right-wing pundits and talk radio, were pressured into forcing a government shutdown that eventually blew up in their faces. 

Ever since the 90s, Republicans have become dependent on right-wing outlets like Fox News and Rush Limbaugh to rally and mobilize their supporters. That’s garnered them success in major elections, but it’s also backed them into a corner. Republicans know they can’t betray the conservative pundits who helped elect them, but those pundits are becoming more and more ideologically extreme, pressuring Republicans to shut the government down over even minor funding disputes. 

As long as right-wing media has a stranglehold on conservative politics, Republicans will keep finding themselves steered into crises they know they can’t win.

Start by watching our explainer on the marginal tax rate: https://youtu.be/VJhsjUPDulw

While it might seem like a radical idea, it's actually based on an economic theory that tries to make everyone as well-off as possible.

How can we make all citizens as well-off as possible? That's the simple question behind something call ""optimal tax theory."" It starts from this idea that, to a rich person, one dollar is worth almost nothing. Take away the dollar and he'll be just as well off as he was before. But that dollar is worth a lot to poor people. So, if the government wants to optimize the well-being of its citizens, it should tax that money from the rich and give it to the poor. But at a certain point, we can't keep taxing the rich more. To find out why, watch this video.

Today, the US is facing a migration crisis on its southern border with Mexico. Thousands of people from Central America, especially Guatemala and Honduras, are fleeing their home countries, taking a dangerous journey north through Mexico, and claiming asylum in the US. How did this crisis begin? Much of it can be traced back to the 1970s cocaine trade. Cocaine, which is mostly produced in Colombia, used to be shipped by boat and plane across the Caribbean. But in the 80s and 90s, the US cracked down on this route, so traffickers started shipping their drugs through Central America and over land to Mexico. That created a violent and competitive turf war between gangs and organizations in Guatemala and Honduras, and after the governments cracked down, violence only increased, forcing people to flee, often to the US.

Robert Falcon Scott was a British explorer who dreamed of being the first person to reach the South Pole. In 1912, he reached the Pole only to learn that his Norwegian rival, Roald Amundsen, had beat him to it. Caught by freakish weather and a string of bad luck, his entire party died trying to get back. Reasons for his failure range from his use of ponies rather than dogs to a highly unusual temperature drop that made the journey back impossible to survive.

In this episode of Vox Almanac, producer Phil Edwards explores the past and present of the DeLorean Motor Company, which made the infamous DMC-12. Though many today know the car through the movie Back to the Future, DeLorean has its own incredible story to tell (and one that’s almost harder to believe than a story about time travel).

John Z. DeLorean is at its center as the founder and namesake of the company. His path through the upper echelon of General Motors seemed to have set him on course for that company’s Presidency — but he dreamed of starting his own company. The result was the DeLorean Motor Company, which was established in America and eventually planted a factory in Dunmurry, Ireland, near Belfast and during the sectarian civil war known as “the Troubles.”

For this video, we interviewed Barrie Wills about his experience working at the company — but we also talked to DeLorean owners about the ways the car has endured, thanks to the movie Back to the Future, and, more importantly, their own ingenuity and creativity. A DeLorean community has kept the car going and, despite the fact that production ended in the early '80s, the car continues to inspire new fans even today.

Check out the Today, Explained podcast episode on El Chapo here: https://bit.ly/2DaFZS8

Throughout his career as a drug trafficker, tunnels have been the common theme in El Chapo’s story. When he gained control of a major drug trafficking corridor in the late 1980s, Joaquin Guzman Loera — then known as “el Rapido”— was the first to create super tunnels for transporting drugs across the border.

At the time, a crackdown by the U.S. Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA) meant Colombian cocaine was in decline and the Mexican narcotrafficker saw an opportunity. By using tunnels to facilitate fast transport, El Chapo leveraged his role as a trafficker to claim new responsibilities as a cultivator and distributor of drugs. 

Over the next twenty years, he learned how to use his drug tunnels in ways nobody had ever imagined and his success became dependent on his subterranean inclinations. Although his masterful use of tunnels led him to a maximum security jail cell at Altiplano prison, it would be tunnels that also led him back out again.

German Chancellor Angela Merkel has been called the most powerful woman in the world, the liberal West's last defender, and the de facto leader of Europe. But 19 years after entering politics, she has announced she won't be running for a fifth term as chancellor and will be stepping away from politics. Her announcement comes at a pivotal time when nationalism is on the rise in Europe and the continent is still reeling from the 2015 migrant crisis. So what does Merkel stepping down mean for the future of Germany — and for the European Union?

Stinson spent 23 years in a Wisconsin prison for murder after two forensic odontologists concluded that his teeth matched bite marks found on the body of the victim. 

False Positive looks at the structural and cultural factors that have made the U.S. criminal justice system susceptible to unreliable forensic science, and that continue to impede progress toward more reliable methods today.

The White House press conference has always been a frustrating spectacle, with reporters trying to pry information from government officials who do everything in their power to avoid sharing too much information. But these press conferences are typically appreciated because of their symbolic value -- they reaffirm the democratic idea that the government must answer to the people.

That symbolic value has changed under Trump, who uses press conferences to stage high profile fights with the press and mobilize his base.

Do you know someone struggling with video gambling? Help ProPublica understand video slots and poker addiction in Illinois: https://www.propublica.org/getinvolved/help-us-investigate-illinois-video-gambling-addiction 

Nearly a decade ago, Illinois lawmakers legalized video gambling. They hoped that the machines, which offered up electronic versions of games like slots or poker, would generate billions of dollars of revenue for the state. So they passed a bill quickly, with little debate, to expand the industry dramatically. Illinois now has more than 30,000 of these machines, and more locations to legally place a bet than Nevada.

A ProPublica Illinois investigation has found that the expansion of video gambling hasn’t pulled Illinois out of debt — it’s actually accelerated it. While people in Illinois have gambled a lot more on machines that can be highly addictive, most of the additional money has ended up in the hands of a small group of companies behind video gambling. 

Watch the video above to find out what this could mean for the states and cities across the country considering gambling expansions.

Carbon cycles through earth at a steady pace. Plants and microorganisms absorb carbon, which helps them grow. Animals and bacteria eat the plants, breathe out carbon into the atmosphere, and take some carbon underground when they die. And a similar process happens in the ocean. It's nearly a closed loop, although some plants and animals don't decay fast enough so they turn into fossil fuel, which traps the carbon underground. But one animal started to dig up that carbon — and burn it.

Games today are meticulously detailed. They’re mysterious and heartwarming, and colorful and stylized. And that makes them a technical challenge. Though computing power has skyrocketed, gamemakers keep competing to add more detail to their games, pushing the limits of what even the newest technology can compute. Game technology needs to constantly keep up with gamemakers’ creative ambitions.

Triangles are a key part of how these gorgeous, detailed games appear on your screen — the hidden heroes we should all thank as we play. This simple shape helps keep the number of computations needed for each detail as low as possible, allowing the player's computer to process these elaborate games. 

Watch the video above to find out how triangles make room for creators to build the beautiful games that exist today.

Become a member of the Vox Video Lab! https://www.vox.com/join

Subscribe to our channel! http://goo.gl/0bsAjO

Lawmakers, activists, and reformers want to end cash bail, the practice of requiring a defendant to pay money to be released from jail before trial. 

Mounting evidence has shown that cash bail unfairly affects low-income minorities who don’t have the money to pay for release before their trial. As a result, defendants languish in jail while waiting for court dates. 

While in jail, many of them lose their jobs, housing, and parental rights, all of which can weaken their community network, erode domestic relationships, and cost the government money to keep them in jail. 

Defenders of cash bail claim it is an effective mechanism for keeping violent criminals in jail. Despite their efforts to protect the status quo, several states have pursued bail reform. These states model their new systems on a pretrial risk assessment system. Risk assessments use algorithms to analyze data about a defendant and make recommendations for their pretrial release. 

The District of Columbia has used risk assessments since the early 1990s with success. But many reform activists are concerned that when cash bail is replaced with risk assessments, courts are using another unjust — and potentially more biased — pretrial release mechanism.

Join the Vox Video Lab! https://www.vox.com/join

After the ball drops in Times Square on New Year's Eve, the crowd cheers, couples kiss, confetti flies and the song you hear is ""Auld Lang Syne."" For Americans this song is associated with another year passing, but it means something else entirely in other cultures. Since the Scottish poet Robert Burns first published the words to the song in the 18th century, the melody has been adapted as a soccer ballad in the Netherlands, a graduation song in Japan, and more. 

This video explains how an obscure Scottish folk tune took on new life around the world and how Guy Lombardo solidified it as the sound the US hears at the stroke of midnight on New Year's Eve.

What was the deal with that monk haircut? In this episode of Vox Almanac, Phil Edwards explores the history and controversy behind the style.

Known as ""tonsure,"" the typical monk hairstyle has many variations throughout religions. The particular hairstyle worn by Christian monks has its own variations and controversies as well.  Three different types of tonsure were popular: a coronal tonsure, a Pauline tonsure, and a third Celtic tonsure that came to represent the differences between the Roman Catholic and Celtic Catholic church.

The winding path of this tonsure is a new way to look at the division within the religion and the unpredictable ways something like hair can represent faith.

Subscribe to our channel! http://goo.gl/0bsAjO

Venereal disease has long been an issue for militaries, but during World War II, the problem became bigger and more global. That required unusual tactics and unorthodox strategies to beat syphilis and gonorrhea during the war. In this episode of Vox Almanac, Phil Edwards explores some of the ways the United States military fought this epidemic.

Starting with Bousbir in Casablanca, it’s a tour of the uneasy relationship the military had with prostitution, recreational sex, and the venereal diseases that soldiers contracted. Both in America and around the world, it was a significant problem that resulted in health troubles and days lost on the battlefield.

Colombia is the world’s largest producer of cocaine and the US is the largest consumer of the drug. Cocaine comes from the leaf of the coca plant which is harvested and processed in Colombia. Despite the Colombian government’s effort to eradicate the plant, coca cultivation is at an all time high. In this episode we go deep into the cocaine economy and discover why this problem is so hard to solve.

Saudi Arabia and the US have a partnership that's been in the making for over seven decades. It started after World War II and survived the Iranian Revolution, the Cold War, the Gulf War, September 11, and the proliferation of conflicts across the Middle East. This whole time, the US has been selling weapons to Saudi Arabia -- now its number one customer. Saudis bought bombs, tanks, guns, and planes over the years to defend themselves from various threats. The US supplied those weapons because the Saudi’s threats have usually been a threat to the US as well.

Today, there's a shift in the relationship. Saudi Arabia’s intervention in Yemen has created the worst humanitarian disaster in the world - and thrown the Middle East into chaos. The problem is, the Saudis are using US bombs to do it.

With Twitter’s new emoji tracking tool, advertisers can track how and when users post emojis and determine users’ emotional state. Depending on those feelings, they can deliver ads that best match their emotions at that time.

Advertisers say that this will allow them to deliver more relevant ads, but there are opposite concerns about consumer privacy. Watch this video to learn how advertisers are using this tool and how it changes the ads users see on Twitter.

Cumbia is a growing staple of Latin American music. Its driving beat can be heard all over the continent, from Argentina to Mexico to the US. Cumbia’s catchy rhythms can be traced back to the villages along the river banks of Colombia’s Rio Magdalena where mostly African and American indigenous musical elements fused together to create a whole new style of music. And cumbia keeps evolving. Today DJs and pop stars are bringing cumbia into the electronic realm. But no matter how much it evolves, it always comes back to Colombia.

Subscribe to our channel! http://goo.gl/0bsAjO

An alleged discrimination case against Harvard has put the affirmative action debate in the spotlight again — this time with Asian Americans being used to make the case against it. But the problem is, the way we talk about race in college admissions hasn’t changed for years…and it’s often wrong. 

While we may think of affirmative action as a policy that boosts college applicants of color to help undo the effects of historical discrimination — the Supreme Court has actually narrowed the use of affirmative action over decades of rulings. And now, armed with an allegation that Harvard is using race in college admissions to discriminate against Asian applicants — conservative opponents of affirmative action may put the issue back in the hands of a majority-conservative Supreme Court. 

Watch the video above to find out what we get wrong about the debate, and how Asians may fit into the complicated use of affirmative action in US college admissions.

Subscribe to our channel! http://goo.gl/0bsAjO

About 80 to 90 percent of sandy beaches along America's coastlines are eroding. This is a problem because the developments humans build near them are static. So as beaches shrink, coastal hazards can threaten to damage or destroy homes and businesses while negatively impacting tourism that depends on the beach. 

The most popular strategy to counter these risks is a process called beach nourishment. Coastal engineers will add new sand to an eroding beach in order to rebuild or expand the shoreline. 
Watch the video above to learn more about how beach nourishments can help defend the coast but are problematic as a long-term solution.

Drug lord Pablo Escobar smuggled four hippos into his own personal zoo during the 1980’s. But wild hippos are usually only native to Africa and their escape after Escobar’s death has left Colombia with an unexpected problem. Due to reproduction, there are now dozens roaming around one of the country’s rivers.

This episode looks at how the presence of these hippos affects Colombia’s biodiversity and how people became fond of their presence.

Follow Vox Earworm on Facebook for more: http://www.facebook.com/VoxEarworm

Smooth jazz has gotten a bad rap for decades. It’s often associated with background music for elevators or the soundtrack at the dentist office. Smooth jazz is less a genre of music than a highly researched radio format and, although it’s heyday was in the 1990s and it’s mostly associated with Kenny G, its origins go back the mid 1960s when a select few jazz musicians crossed over to pop music and had music purists riling. Artists like Grover Washington Jr.  and George Benson took the style to new heights and created the sound that we all know and love….to hate.

Read more about CBD on Vox.com: https://www.vox.com/the-goods/2018/11/1/18024806/cbd-oil-vape-hemp

Cannabidiol is having a moment. Increasingly common state legalization and loose federal regulation means that anyone in any state can go online or to a physical store and buy CBD products — from oils to dog treats to bath bombs — without fear of arrest. It’s been shown to help treat a number of conditions including psychosis, anxiety, movement disorders, multiple sclerosis, and epilepsy and seizures. For years, people have used medical marijuana to address those conditions — but CBD is showing promise as a possible way to get the benefits of medical cannabis without getting high. 

Here’s the catch: Most of the CBD products that have trickled down to the consumer market are poorly labeled and have extremely low doses. Granted, it’s possible that the placebo effect is providing CBD users with tangible benefits. And it’s also possible that low-dose CBD products can act as a form of microdosing, where users take small amounts of a substance to achieve milder or entirely different results than a full dose. 

CBD isn’t a scam. It’s a powerful substance with a lot of medical potential. But most of the stuff on the market now probably isn’t worth your time.

With original music by Tom Fox: https://m.soundcloud.com/user-416166523

Colombia is currently dealing with a massive wave of refugees coming from Venezuela. Venezuelans are fleeing their home because of a severe economic crisis under President Nicolas Maduro. There are high inflation rates and there isn’t enough food available for people within Venezuela to even eat. Thousands of Venezuelans cross the Simon Bolivar bridge located at Cúcuta every day and Colombia doesn’t seem to be turning anyone way. 

This borders episode looks at why Colombia doesn’t turn away these refugees, the shared history of the two nations and how there may be a limit to Colombia’s acceptance of incoming Venezuelans.

Fox News constantly accuses other news organizations of having a liberal bias, claiming networks like CNN and MSNBC are in bed with the Democratic Party. But over the past few years, major Fox personalities ike Sean Hannity, Laura Ingraham, and Jeanine Pirro have become more open about their support for the Republican Party -- appearing at GOP campaign events, speaking at Republican fundraisers, and even explicitly endorsing Republican candidates on air. Republican candidates have noticed, and have begun using friendly coverage on Fox as part of their campaign strategies. 

Fox News is transforming from a right-wing news network into a full-on Republican campaign operation. Pretty soon, people like Sean Hannity won’t have to leave their studio sets to be on the campaign trail.

Subscribe to our channel! http://goo.gl/0bsAjO

Netflix has thousands of videos to choose from for a night (or day) of marathon watching. The problem is: how do you pick what to watch? It can be daunting searching through various titles, so much so that you may end up skipping to watch anything altogether. Netflix tries to make it easier to pick titles through personalization of their site—including the thumbnails you’ll see for every piece of content in their catalog. 

With thousands of videos to choose from, and more than 130 million subscriber in 190 countries, there’s a lot of potential to create some eye-catching thumbnails according to users’ tastes. So the company uses a set of algorithms to determine what images you’re more likely to click on. It’s just one streaming service on the frontier of personalizing how content is served to its viewers. Netflix’s goal is to get you engaged with their content for as long as possible. And ever changing customizable thumbnails is just one of their methods.

Follow Vox Earworm on Facebook for more: http://www.facebook.com/VoxEarworm

When asked to visualize what jazz looks like, you might picture bold typography, two tone photography, and minimal graphic design. If you did, you’re recalling the work of a jazz label that single-handedly defined the “look” of jazz music in the 1950s and1960s: Blue Note. 

Inspired by the ever present Swiss lettering style that defined 20th century graphic design (think Paul Rand), Blue Note captured the refined sophistication of jazz during the early 60s, particularly during the hard bop era, and gave it a definitive visual identity through album covers.

Haunted houses are often depicted with similar features: decaying woodwork, steep angles, and Gothic-looking towers and turrets. The model for this trope is the Victorian mansion, once a symbol of affluence and taste during the Gilded Age - a period of American history marked by political corruption and severe income inequality. 

After World War I, these houses were seen as extravagant and antiquated, and were abandoned. Their sinister relationship to the troubling end of the Victorian Era in America eventually led to their depiction as haunted and ghostly in both fine art and pop culture, and is now an unspoken symbol of dread.

John Coltrane, one of jazz history’s most revered saxophonists, released “Giant Steps” in 1959. It’s known across the jazz world as one of the most challenging compositions to improvise over for two reasons - it’s fast and it’s in three keys. Braxton Cook and Adam Neely give me a crash course in music theory to help me understand this notoriously difficult song, and I’m bringing you along for the ride. Even if you don’t understand a lick of music theory, you’ll likely walk away with an appreciation for this musical puzzle.

Subscribe to our channel! http://goo.gl/0bsAjO

World War I’s horrors not only resulted in death, but severe disfigurement. When plastic surgeons were unable to heal the wounded, a unique solution came in play: sculpting.
Facial prostheses in World War I were a new solution to a difficult problem, and sculptor and writer Anna Coleman Ladd led these efforts for the American Red Cross in France. She made more than 150 masks for the wounded in an effort to provide some semblance of normalcy after their severe injuries.

These masks were made by making casts of the wounded faces, and then sculpting restored faces from that. Those sculptures were then used as a cast for thin copper-plated attachments, which were then attached to the wounded soldier’s face and painted. Though the process wasn’t restorative, it did provide some comfort to the wounded.

That experience shaped Anna Coleman Ladd’s art as well. When she returned to America, she was willing to depict the horrors of war in her War Memorial, as well as the possibility for a new and better day ahead.

https://www.vox.com/pages/newsletters

When Trump took office the Republicans tried to repeal The Affordable Care Act, but they failed. What became clear during their attempt to get rid of The ACA, also called “Obamacare”, is that people like it. Voters are even supportive of The ACA in red states where voters despise the name “Obama”, but tend to embrace the protections of his health care plan. In particular, protections for pre-existing conditions are very popular amongst American voters. Two years ago, Democrats were clearly in favor of The ACA and Republicans were against it, but now conservatives are having to bend their platforms to account for popular provisions of ACA. 

The difference between the 2016 campaign platforms and now is stark. In 2018, the midterm elections is shaping around one big question: whether pre-existing protections will be protected. Despite having worked hard to remove protections for nearly a decade, Republicans are now saying they’ll fight to protect them…but what do they really mean when they say that?

Subscribe to our channel! http://goo.gl/0bsAjO

October is a tense month in American in politics. The closer a political campaign gets to election day, the more vulnerable it is to an “October Surprise” -- a late-breaking scandal or controversy that influences voters in the final days of an election. 

“October Surprises” are typically thought of as unexpected events that surprise both sides of an election -- natural disasters, terrorist attacks, etc.. But more recently, it's come to describe an intentional campaign strategy, wherein political operatives exploit late-breaking news stories to try to damage their opponents at the last-minute.

Trump’s fixation on the migrant caravan traveling to the United States is a clear example of that strategy -- an attempt to shift the media’s attention away from issues like health care by fear mongering about immigrants. 

It’s a cheap political ploy, and many news networks have recognized it as such. The problem is: there’s no great way to fight it.

Voter purges are a means of removing ineligible voter registrations from the rolls — meant to clean up the system. But what happens when aggressive purges end up getting rid of the registrations of eligible voters? 

Critics say states like Georgia and Ohio - purging through “exact match” or “use it or lose it” laws - are disproportionately eliminating thousands of minority voters from the system. 

What states are doing them, how do they work, and what should you do if you find out you’ve been purged?

When the North American Free Trade Agreement began in 1994, auto companies in the US, Canada and Mexico could trade parts and cars without paying tariffs. And they could source parts and labor from the cheapest places. That is a big reason why US car prices have only risen seven percent in 25 years. 

But the US Mexico Canada Agreement -- or USMCA for short -- could change that; the new law would increase the regulations that car manufacturers need to meet in order to sell tariff-free cars.

Republicans have broken politics.,2018-10-29 14:30:39+00:00,"Neither party is perfect, but Republicans in Congress have been drifting towards political extremism since long before Trump, and they’re making it impossible for Congress to work the way it’s supposed to.

Subscribe to our channel! http://goo.gl/0bsAjO

Over the past few decades, both Democrats and Republicans in Congress have moved away from the center. But the Republican Party has moved towards the extreme much more quickly -- a trend that political scientists’ call “asymmetrical polarization.”

That asymmetry poses a major obstacle in American politics. As Republicans have become more ideological, they’ve also become less willing to work with Democrats: filibustering Democratic legislation, refusing to consider Democratic appointees, and even shutting down the government in order to force Democrats to give in to their demands. 

Democrats have responded in turn, becoming more obstructionist as Republican demands become more extreme. 

And that’s made it really easy for media outlets to blame “both sides” for political gridlock. As political scientists Thomas Mann and Norm Ornstein explain in their book “It’s Even Worse Than It Looks,” journalists feel a pressure to remain neutral when covering big political fights. So politics coverage has been dominated by the myth that both parties are equally to blame for the gridlock in DC. 

But they’re not. And the only way to stop Republicans in Congress from continuing their drift towards the extreme is to be brutally honest about who’s responsible for breaking our politics.

In 2014, the largest corruption scandal in Latin America’s history erupted in Brazil. It involved bribes between Petrobras, the largest state-owned oil company on the continent, and dozens of engineering firms. It also involved politicians, including three Brazilian presidents, Lula, Dilma Rousseff, and Michel Temer, as well as almost a third of Brazil’s congress. 

Politicians all over Latin America were found guilty of taking bribes and profiting immensely from infrastructure and energy projects all over the continent. The scandal hit places like Itaborai especially hard. The companies involved were fined billions of dollars and laid off hundreds of thousands of workers as their projects abruptly stopped. Four years later, Brazil is still dealing with the fallout.

Brazil just held potentially the most important election in its history on October 28th, 2018. Two candidates faced off; Fernando Haddad represented the Workers’ Party, which has been in power for much of the past two decades. His opponent was far-right congressman Jair Bolsonaro, who won the election in part by positioning himself as a political outsider with no part in Brazil's sweeping corruption.

With soaring crime and rampant corruption in government, Brazilian voters showed they are eager for change — a desire Bolsonaro effectively capitalized on. But with his deeply offensive rhetoric toward minorities, many Brazilians are worried about their safety and the future of their country's democracy.

The news can be confusing, overwhelming, and worst of all, incomplete.

That’s where we come in.

The Vox video team is launching a new show with YouTube Originals, and it’s unlike anything we’ve done before. Instead of coming up with a bunch of story ideas ourselves, we want your questions to drive our reporting.

Tell us: What’s the most important question facing the world in 2019? It can be about anything — science, money, health, relationships, tech, government, and beyond.

Your video could be featured in our upcoming series, and we’ll choose 12 of the best question-askers to join us on camera as we report the answers.

Do you have a great question for us to explore? Here’s what to do next. Upload a video by Monday, November 5 at www.vox.com/showme telling us your name, where you live, your question, and a personal story about what got you interested in the topic: Did something happen to you or to someone you know? Did you see something in the news and think, “Huh?”

Want to increase the likelihood we pick your question? Make sure you’re in the center of the frame, and if you’re on your phone, flip it horizontally! Try to keep windows and bright lights out of the background, and background noise to a minimum. Use an external microphone — earbuds with a built-in mic work great!

In this episode of Vox Almanac, Vox’s Phil Edwards explores the history of a common default keyboard configuration among gamers. Though there’s an inherent logic to WASD — it just works well — there’s also a story behind how it became a near-universal standard.

Dennis “Thresh” Fong was one of the first pro gamers to go mainstream playing the first person shooter Quake. By doing so, he set a standard for other gamers to aspire to, including his key control configuration. He discovered that for a new era in which the mouse and keyboard needed to work together, WASD was a great way to do it. Shortly after that, programmers incorporated his schema into their own games, making it a default that millions — whether they knew Thresh or not — would play with. WASD became a standard for a lot of games because of one superstar’s amazing record with it.

Subscribe to our channel! http://goo.gl/0bsAjO

Researchers estimate that 50 percent of purchases are unplanned. These purchases, especially impulse buys, present an opportunity for retailers who can entice consumers to deviate from their shopping lists.

One of the most effective ways to influence this is through a store’s architecture. In the 20th century, the architect Victor Gruen, who pioneered the first American shopping malls, used light and space to dramatically stage goods in storefront windows. His designs were meant to capture the attention of passersby — and convert them into customers. This conversion became known as the “Gruen effect.”

Watch the video above to learn how Ikea has mastered the Gruen effect with a carefully designed store layout that gets customers to travel further distances… and buy more.

For the curious, here are a few links:

Read Jeffrey Inman’s research on unplanned spending: http://www.advancingretail.org/sites/default/files/resources/The-Effect-of-In-Store-Travel-Distance-on-Unplanned-Spending.pdf

Fictional universes and crossovers have been around long before the Marvel Cinematic Universe. The Green Hornet radio show had a crossover with the Lone Ranger that kicked off the trend. In comics, the Marvel Universe started long before Stan Lee was at the helm.
 
But these crossovers have a problem: They can privilege business relationships ahead of storytelling immersion and really interesting universes. As the Tommy Westphall Universe shows, crossovers often become a map of business decisions rather than of integrated fictional stories, and that leads to worse stories.
 
This problem plagues the MCU as well. When Marvel engineers crossovers, they aren’t thinking about a universe transformed by superheroes — they just want more quips, explosions, and cash. Or at least that’s Edwards’s argument — do you think the MCU works?

Overrated is a series that takes a look at the things we all know — the books, the trends, and the ideas that have become iconic — and answers the question: “Why is this so famous""?

Four years after the shooting death of Laquan McDonald, the police officer, Jason Van Dyke, faced his day in court. But in a trial where race became central to the case, there’s only one black person on the jury. And that’s in a county where nearly a quarter of people are black. How did this happen?

In jury selection, racial discrimination has historically been tricky. Discrimination isn’t allowed in jury selection, thanks to what’s called a “Batson challenge.” But the problem is — Batson has been widely regarded as a failure at keeping racism out of the jury box. Watch the video above to find out why that is, and why it complicates the prospect of a fair trial by jury.

“Exercise contagion in a global social network”, Sinan Aral & Christos Nicolaides. Nature Communications, 2017.

The Global Positioning System, or GPS, is changing the sport of running. Using GPS makes it easier to track, analyze, and share data about your runs. Some people, like Gene Lu, use the technology to create elaborate drawings, but you don’t need to be an artist in order to use GPS to improve your running. 

Researchers at The Massachusetts Institute of Technology conducted a study and determined that runners who share their efforts on social networks tend to run farther, faster, and longer than those who do not. With GPS, it’s easy to track and share data about your run. Along with the proliferation of GPS technology, the number of fitness-focused social networks has also increased. Now, runners have many options for where they can go to share their runs: Strava, Nike Run Club, MapMyRun and many others have all made sharing your run easy by developing mobile apps that users can download to their phones. 

Whether you’re like Gene, who uploads elaborate runs mapped to look like Darth Vader, or just using the app to track your daily jog, social network sharing, made even easier by GPS tracking, can help you improve.

Subscribe to our channel! http://goo.gl/0bsAjO

In this episode of Overrated, Vox’s Phil Edwards gets nunchucked in his heart by ninjas. But why are these secret killers known around the world?

The history of ninjas is, fittingly, one with many hidden twists and turns. It starts with the real historical ninjas in feudal Japan, who really did practice what we call ninjutsu. Their mixture of espionage, assassination, and combat was similar to what ninja-fans might imagine, though the reality was more about traveling incognito than looking cool in a black jumpsuit.

From there, the ninja quickly became a myth in Japanese culture, entering kabuki theatre as well as manga and novels of the time. Already, the exaggeration of the ninja in Japan had begun, a trend that continued with myth-making Japanese films that vaulted the imaginary ninja into public consciousness.

Finally, the ninja traveled to the West from these Japanese films, first showing up in James Bond, and then becoming part of a ninja-sploitation trend. Soon, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles proved the ninja was so famous it could take on postmodern incarnations.

But nearly from the beginning, the ninja was as powerful an idea as a reality, a myth in both Japanese and western culture. And, perhaps most importantly, every version of the ninja — real or not — turned out to be awesome.

In past decades, Christopher Columbus has gone from unquestioned US hero to problematic figure. For centuries, the destruction and disease he ushered into the Americas have been set aside, allowing the myth of a pioneering sailor who discovered America and proved the world was round to embed itself in US culture. But as this myth has been increasingly confronted with brutal historical facts, things have started to change. 

While Columbus still has a national holiday in his honor, complete with parades and celebrations, there are many people fighting to dismantle the myth that surrounds him and choosing to celebrate Indigenous Peoples’ Day instead.

Watch this video to understand how Columbus became a US icon over time and why his status is in question today.

Correction: Many of you pointed out that we erroneously used “Russia” and “Russian” interchangeably with “Soviet Union” and “Soviet” in this video. The Soviet Union was a multiethnic federation, and indeed many non-Russians bore the brunt of Hitler’s initial invasion in 1941. We regret the error — especially in reference to the Soviet soldier raising the flag in the photo, Alexei Kovalev, who is Ukrainian.

Additionally, we inaccurately stated that Rosenthal’s photo was taken following the Battle of Iwo Jima. While the capture of Mt. Suribachi was a significant point in the battle, it was not the end, and in fact three of the six Marines pictured were later killed in action on Iwo Jima.

“Raising the Flag on Iwo Jima” and “Raising a Flag over the Reichstag” are similarly iconic photos from World War II. They’re both beloved images of victory, and they’re both taken after the fighting ended in significant battles. But the Russian one is different, because parts of it are altered. 

Specifically, a watch being worn by one of the soldiers is edited out, to cover up the possibility that he had been looting. The Soviet invasion of Germany saw brutal acts of civilian murder, rape, and looting as a vengeful act following Operation Barbarossa, Hitler’s 1941 invasion of Russia that left millions dead, including women and children.

Jackson Pollock is one of the 20th century’s most famous artists. But do you know the critic who made his reputation?

Clement Greenberg is a well-known name in the art world, but not necessarily to art fans. However, he earned a reputation as one of the most influential art critics in the 20th century, whose legacy included the canonization of Jackson Pollock.

Abstract expressionist art needed vocal champions to support challenging, unique work, and Greenberg was the most powerful and vocal in his defense of the art and, in particular, Jackson Pollock. Greenberg went from tie salesman to intellectual in less than a decade, thanks to strongly worded arguments for a new artform. Jackson Pollock was one of his favorite artists, and the two spent time together socially as they simultaneously climbed in the art world.

Is Clement Greenberg the reason that Jackson Pollock is so famous? He’s definitely a part of it — and understanding the role of Greenberg and critics like him can be a useful tool to understanding art in the 20th century.

But that’s not how memory works, and fixating on the gaps in victims’ memories makes it harder for us to take credible allegations seriously. 

Subscribe to our channel! http://goo.gl/0bsAjO

In the weeks since Prof. Christine Blasey Ford accused Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh of sexually assaulting her at a high school gathering, media coverage has focused heavily on Ford’s memories. Ford admits that she can’t remember key details about the incident, including whose house it took place at and how she got home afterward.

Those gaps in her memory have led many of her critics to argue that Ford isn’t credible. Fox News in particular has seized on holes in Ford’s account to raise doubts about her allegations , even floating the theory that Ford may be confusing Kavanaugh for a doppelganger.

But forgetting non-essential details is not unusual for trauma survivors. As my colleague Brian Resnick has explained, human memory is notoriously faulty. We often forget or misremember details about our experiences, even if we initially perceived them clearly. 

That’s especially true for trauma survivors -- like victims of sexual assault. When humans experience intense trauma, our brains have a tendency to hyper-focus on certain pieces of information while ignoring non-essential details. A victim of sexual assault might vividly remember her attacker’s cologne but struggle to remember the layout of the room she was in or what happened in the hours after the attack. Ford, for example, claims to vividly remember the “uproarious laughter” that she heard between Kavanaugh and his friend Mark Judge while she was being assaulted.

In other words, critics who fixate on gaps in Ford’s memory are likely holding trauma survivors to a standard they won’t be able to meet.

Americans are notoriously bad at voting, but it’s not because they’re unpatriotic or lazy. It’s because most states make it really difficult to even register to vote. 

It’s time for the US to join other advanced democracies and implement automatic voter registration. It will make the voting system more accurate and more secure, plus it could give nearly 50 million eligible Americans a chance to decide how their country is run.

In this episode of Overrated, Vox’s Phil Edwards explores the history of frats.
 
The history of fraternities has a lot of ups and downs — and stretches all the way back to America’s founding fathers. Beyond the hazing and beer chugging, there’s a story that includes changes in higher education and even national politics.
 
So why do colleges keep fraternities on campus? The reason is a web of incentives that make fraternities allies to administrators — despite the negatives they sometimes present.

Overrated is a series that takes a look at the things we all know — the books, the trends, and the ideas that have become iconic — and answers the question: “Why is this so famous""?

That makes them a perfect target for trolls, conspiracy theorists, and con artists. 

Subscribe to our channel! http://goo.gl/0bsAjO

Social media sites like Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, and Instagram are built to cater to the base preferences and desires of their users -- figuring out what information people enjoy with and then showing them more of it. That’s a great way to keep people online, but it also makes these platforms prime target for con artists. People are naturally drawn to inflammatory and sensational news stories, regardless of whether or not they're true. So bad actors -- conspiracy theorists, trolls, and fake news writers -- have been tremendously successful in using these platforms to spread false and divisive content that exploit people’s tribal instincts. 

In 2016, it was Macedonian teens making thousands of dollars publishing inflammatory fake stories about Hillary Clinton. After the Parkland shooting, it was random YouTubers going viral by accusing students of being crisis actors. Even the Russian trolls who meddled in the presidential election did so by posting low-quality, highly emotional content to social media -- content they knew would go viral.

The problem with these social media sites isn’t that a few bad apples are ruining the fun. It’s that they’re designed to reward bad apples. And as long as con artists can use these platforms to prey on people’s most base desires, social media sites will continue reflecting the worst of human nature back at us.

There’s a new kind of art installation popping up in cities across the world. It isn’t designed to showcase classical paintings, or to house impressive historical artifacts — it’s designed to be photographed for Instagram. These might not feel like real museums, but they’re a reflection of a real change happening in the museum world right now.

Museums — both new pop-ups and traditional institutions — are capitalizing on smartphone culture by creating spaces whose main appeal is being a backdrop for a great selfie. As more kinds of retail experiences move online, spaces like this — where digital reproducibility through social media is an active part of the design — are only going to get more common.

They’re one of many ‘micro-mobility’ innovations rocketing through the transportation sector. 

Even in cities with exceptional public transportation coverage, gaps persist. This is a decades old problem, often referred to as ‘the last mile/first mile.’ Cities traditionally address the last mile problem by expanding bus routes. But as cities continue to populate while transportation dept budgets dwindle, the patience of commuters is running dry. So scooters, electric skateboards, and pedal assist bikes have become an increasingly popular option for city residents.

These innovations, while quite popular, also draw the ire of the oft-beleaguered sidewalk pedestrian. The past century of development prioritized car transportation, often at the expense of wide sidewalks that were once bustling with life. So the planners of today are taking a page out of history to prepare for a brave new world of alternative transportation.

In this episode of Overrated, Vox’s Phil Edwards explores what Ouija means, from a historical and cultural perspective.
 
The Ouija game and Ouija movies permeate our culture. But their origin might be surprising. Before this board game was a staple, it emerged from the spiritualist movement in the United States in the mid-1800s and an aggressive entrepreneur who believed he could make a buck off of it.
 
Ouija’s overrated — it’s not real and it’s just a piece of cardboard. But it's also a way for people from the past to speak to us (through history, at least).

Poland is changing. In 2015, the far-right Law and Justice party, or PiS, won both the presidential election and a slim parliamentary majority. Since then, they’ve been working to cement their power by firing judges, purging the military and civil service, and cracking down on protesters and the media. All of this has put the country on a collision course with the European Union that could threaten Europe’s hard-won peace and prosperity following centuries of conflict.

OK is thought to be the most widely recognized word on the planet. We use it to communicate with each other, as well as our technology. But it actually started out as a language fad in the 1830’s of abbreviating words incorrectly. 

Young intellectuals in Boston came up with several of these abbreviations, including “KC” for “knuff ced,” “OW” for “oll wright,” and KY for “know yuse.” But thanks to its appearance in Martin Van Buren’s 1840 presidential re-election campaign as the incumbents new nickname, Old Kinderhook, OK outlived its abbreviated comrades. 

Later, widespread use by early telegraph operators caused OK to go mainstream, and its original purpose as a neutral affirmative is still how we use it today.

Allbirds says Steve Madden copied their sneakers. Gucci says Forever 21 ripped off their green-red-green stripes. Adidas says Zara knocked off their Yeezys. 

In the Constitution, Congress has the power to stop copying by giving authors and inventors “the exclusive right to their respective writings and discoveries.” 

But there’s a catch. These protections must “promote the progress” of creative industries. 

Conventional wisdom holds that copying kills innovation and hurts industry progress. But within the fashion industry, experts like New York University law professor Christopher Sprigman say the ease of copying is actually good for creativity.

The characters and storylines that wrestlers craft are epic, dramatic, and engrossing. Wrestling is like one big play, with the ring being the stage.

You can see this best illustrated in wrestler's entrances, which often employ music, costumes, props, and even vehicles to push their stories forward. And wrestlers often try to maintain the illusion that their characters are real at all times, something that's called ""kayfabe"".

At first glance, US President Donald Trump and Russian leader Vladimir Putin seem to have wildly different communication styles. But what they share is a tendency to repeat big, obvious lies -- a tactic researchers have dubbed the “firehose of falsehood.” Whether it’s lying about Russian troops in Crimea or falsely claiming millions of people voted illegally during the 2016 election, both leaders demonstrate a kind of shamelessness when it comes to telling and retelling big lies.

Imran Khan was sworn in as Pakistan’s new prime minister on August 18, but he is no ordinary politician. Before rising to power, he was a dashing cricket superstar. He lead the Pakistani cricket team to victory in the 1992 World Cup against England and became a global celebrity. He settled in England, where his popularity grew and where he was known as a bachelor.

He eventually resettled in Pakistan, where he shed his lady’s-man image and established the political career that lead him to become the head of Pakistan’s government. His strong anti-corruption message and opposition to the political dynasties that have ruled Pakistan for decades helped him ascend to power. But many have accused him of also getting help from Pakistan’s most powerful authority: the military. As Khan starts his tenure, we explore his rise to power and how Pakistan’s political climate might affect his term as prime minister.

Subscribe to our channel! http://goo.gl/0bsAjO

Not everyone will readily admit to peeing in swimming pools, but it does happen. An anonymous survey from 2012 found that 19 percent of adults admitted they had peed in a pool at least once. 

But when you use a pool as a giant toilet, that yellow trail contains some nasty bacteria and parasites. And the amount of urine and other organic materials like sweat, lotion, and dirt can affect the efficacy of chlorine or any other disinfectant in a pool. In some cases, it can take as much as 10 days for chlorine to kill off parasites like Cryptosporidium, one of the biggest culprits of illness outbreaks. 

But besides not swallowing the water when you go swimming, the solution is real simple.

Now that Cohen pleaded guilty on eight federal charges, including two campaign finance violations, the biggest unanswered question is whether the president will also be held accountable.

When you look at a pinball machine, you might think it's nothing more than a bunch of flashing lights. Many people think the game is random, but it’s actually carefully laid out in groups of targets that correlate to specific objectives, called modes. 

These modes, along with the multiball, are the key to achieving higher scores in the game. Once you learn to control the ball using the flippers, start aiming for the targets that are lit – that means they are activated. Once hit, the game will light something else to tell you what to aim for next.

Aretha Franklin will always be the Queen of Soul. In the 1960s songs like “Respect” became the symbol for political and social change. It’s likely the reason her music moved so many people wasn’t necessarily the lyrics, but the way she delivered them. 

Aretha was raised in the church, and her life and music was rooted in gospel music. You can hear this so clearly in her live performances and covers, where every musical decision she made was in the moment. 

Listen to any one of Aretha’s songs and you’ll understand the power of gospel music, but her live performance of “Dr. Feelgood” and her cover of “Son of a preacher man” are a great place to start. 

Special thanks to Brigitta Johnson, Robert Darden, and Raymond Wise for sharing their expertise in gospel music history.

Northern Ireland is part of the UK, but because of a special power-sharing agreement, it has an open border with Republic of Ireland. This was designed as a compromise that ended 30 years of conflict and violence in Northern Ireland between Nationalist and Unionist paramilitaries. 

Today, Brexit means that the UK needs to close its borders and the issue of the Irish border is one of the hardest things to negotiate with the EU. Closing this border could undermine the compromise that kept the peace for 20 years.

Hong Kong is the most expensive housing market in the world. It has been ranked as the least affordable housing market on Earth for eight years in a row, and the price per square foot seems to be only going up. The inflated prices are forcing Hongkongers to squeeze into unconventionally small spaces that can affect their quality of life. 

Tens of thousands of Hongkongers are living in spaces that range from 75 to 140 square feet. To put that in perspective, the average parking space in the US is about 150 square feet. And in the most extreme cases, Hongkongers have resorted to homes the size of a coffin. 

I spent some time exploring the living situation in Hong Kong to find out why housing has become so expensive and spaces so tight. 

To understand how Hong Kong’s housing market turned out this way and see how it’s affecting people’s lives, watch the final episode of Borders Hong Kong.

Subscribe to our channel! http://goo.gl/0bsAjO

Wildfires are intensifying in California — but “wild”fires might be a misnomer at this point, because humans are responsible for why they’ve gotten so out of control. Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences found that 84 percent of fires are started by humans. The Carr fire in northern California, for example, was sparked by the rim of car with a flat tire.

If you look at where California’s population is growing and getting denser, you’ll see that more and more people are building in areas that are at risk, increasing the potential for costly destruction — 2017 was the most expensive year on record, topping $10 billion in damages.

Since we drastically exacerbated this problem, can we swing it back the other way? The impact of man-made climate change is unlikely to reverse. And people continue to build in dangerous areas, with no sign of stopping. By 2050, there could be over 640,000 new homes built in the path of wildfires.

Here’s the research paper explaining how humans start most fires: http://www.pnas.org/content/114/11/2946.full

And here is the data on humans expanding into wildfire territory:

Since the first patent in 1930, electronic cigarettes have taken many shapes. At first they mimicked the packaging and physicality of cigarettes, with a cylindrical shape and light-up tip. Then they trended toward boxier designs, with low nicotine levels and high amounts of vapor. 

The Juul did things differently: it packed a high-nicotine, low vapor hit in a small, USB drive-shaped package, with a colorful range of flavors and a buttonless, intuitive design. It wasn't just a hot new e-cigarette — it was a hot new tech gadget. Now, middle schools and high schools across the US are nervous about how many kids are getting hooked on Juuls.

Subscribe to our channel! http://goo.gl/0bsAjO

Fingerprinting has been a vital tool in forensic science since 1911 when the first conviction was handed out based on fingerprint evidence. It’s been used in countless investigations to help convict or rule out suspects, but is it as reliable as we think?

According to one study, researchers found that fingerprint analysts had a false positive rate (i.e. when they incorrectly conclude two prints are a match) of 0.1%. That may seem low, but that percentage reveals that innocent people are still being implicated in crimes.

Brandon Mayfield is one of the most famous examples of a false positive identification. The FBI arrested him for the 2004 Madrid train bombing based on a wrongful fingerprint match.

Most people agree that it’s a useful tool, but we might want to exercise a bit more skepticism when it comes to trusting fingerprints.

Subscribe to our channel! http://goo.gl/0bsAjO

Abortion has been a subject of debate for decades, and now, President Trump is poised to tip the balance of the Supreme Court into one that could reverse the historic decision that established a woman’s right to choose: Roe v. Wade.

The case of Roe v. Wade is a frequently a stand-in when we talk about abortion rights, and Trump would be fulfilling a campaign promise by appointed judges that could, in theory, overturn the decision.

But although the landmark 1973 ruling made abortion legal — in fact, a guaranteed constitutional right governed under the right to privacy — states have limited powers to regulate the practice. And they have been given more and more authority to add restrictions and regulations that limit that right to a smaller number of individuals.

There are 1,193 state-level restrictions on abortion, and for some women, it has functionally made abortion inaccessible. And if the Court does overturn Roe v. Wade, some states already have laws that would automatically ban some or all abortion. But many American women already live as if that were the case.

Hong Kong’s famous skyline is known for its colorful lights and modern buildings, but a closer look reveals some unique designs inspired by feng shui. Like the gaping holes in the middle of buildings to let dragons fly through or cannon-like structures installed to deflect bad “qi” (pronounced chi). 

The main belief in feng shui is that destiny is bound to the environment, so good fortune and harmony can be invited in and bad energy can be warded off by arranging objects and buildings around us. It's an ancient Chinese practice that has come to define Hong Kong's skyline. 

In this episode of Borders, we explore feng shui principles, explain the circumstances that allowed it to flourish in Hong Kong and take a look at the unique designs around the city.

New indictments against twelve Russian hackers give us a detailed account of just how they infiltrated the Democratic National Committee’s network. 

It started with a single spear phishing email; a personalized, targeted hacking attempt sent to an employee at the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee. Once inside the DCCC network they were also able to gain access to the DNC using malware on employee’s computers. 

In 2016 the Russian hackers stole thousands of emails and sensitive documents — all because of one phishing email. 

It’s not just political organizations that are at risk: you’ll likely be targeted as well. And it’s getting harder and harder to spot a fake email or text message. Find out how to prevent hackers from getting to you, too.

The Ring of Fire is a band of volcanoes and frequent earthquakes that runs from New Zealand, up through Eastern Asia, across the Bering Strait and all the way down to the Southern tip of Chile. Volcanoes, earthquakes, and tsunamis appear around the boundaries of the several, fast moving, tectonic plates that make up the region. When the plates collide, they create areas of volatility. 

The Ring of Fire sees more natural disasters than anywhere else on Earth, but what makes it particularly dangerous is that few countries are prepared.

When Britain handed Hong Kong back to China in 1997, Chinese leaders agreed that Hong Kong would be able to keep its economic and political systems, including some of the civil freedoms denied to China’s citizens on the mainland, for the next 50 years.

Although Hong Kong still has nearly 30 years of semi-autonomy left, China has started tightening its grip, and many believe it is chipping away at Hong Kong’s freedoms. In this episode, I explore how Hong Kong is dealing with the looming deadline and China’s premature moves.

It’s hard to miss someone as they swing their arms around pointing at the musicians that seem to be focused instead on their music stands. So what exactly is the conductor doing? 

We decided to ask James Gaffigan – a conductor who recently guest conducted the New York Philharmonic in Central Park – just what it is that makes a conductor so necessary and how their actions shape the performance.

Over the course of the 20th century, the car became America’s dominant mode of transportation. As vehicle miles travelled soared well past the rate of population growth, demands on the roadway surged. Congestion became a major issue. So transportation planners made the roads wider and added traffic lanes.

Today, we now know that bigger roads and extra traffic lanes do nothing to solve congestion. In fact, it tends to induce even more traffic. So we didn’t fix the congestion issues, and on top of that, we built wide roads that are relatively unsafe.

Transportation planners in the 21st century recognized that many of the roads that were overbuilt could be redesigned to calm speeding and add space for newer multimodal transportation options. And thus, the road diet was born.

The video above explains why road diets are implemented, and how planners survey the feasibility of a lane reconfiguration. You can learn more about road diets with the following resources:

Even though Britain gave Hong Kong back to China 21 years ago, today when you walk around the city you can see British fingerprints everywhere. From statues of Queen Victoria to double decker buses, British culture and lifestyle is baked into the culture at every turn. 

Both the history and the current-day British influence are visually fascinating stories and in this episode I show it all -- exploring Britain’s imperial history, which includes opioid trade, discrimination and a divided city, and then showing the effects of that history, resulting in a city that is unlike any I’ve visited.

Hobos, or tramps, were itinerant workers and wanderers who illegally hopped freight cars on the newly expanding railroad in the United States in the late 19th century. They used graffiti, also known as tramp writing, as a messaging system to tell their fellow travelers where they were and where they were going. Hobos would carve or draw their road persona, or moniker, on stationary objects near railroad tracks, like water towers and bridges.

But news stories at the time spread tales of a different kind of graffiti. They included coded symbols that were supposedly drawn on fence posts and houses to convey simple messages to tramps. Seeing an image of a cat on a fence post indicated “kind lady lives here,” for example. While this language probably existed to a certain extent, it certainly was not as widespread as the media led readers to believe. In reality, these stories were largely informed by hobos — a group that took pride in embellishing stories so they could remain elusive.","['vox.com', 'vox', 'explain', 'hobo', 'tramp', 'rail', 'railroad', 'graffiti', 'art', 'hobo graffiti', 'hobo code', 'hobo symbols', 'hobo code symbols', 'bill daniels', 'bozo texino', 'who is bozo texino', 'freight hopping', 'freight hoppers', 'train graffiti', 'train hopping', 'etching', 'moniker', 'language']",none,337.0,hd,true,1448983.0,30385.0,792.0,Monday,23

Subscribe to our channel! http://goo.gl/0bsAjO

While oil spills have declined over the years, they still happen, and when they do, it can be devastating to the environment. One natural way to help contain oil spills is through the use of hair booms and hair mats. Hair is a naturally hydrophobic and biosorbent, which means, it repels water and can collect heavy metals and other contaminants, like oil. 

The more popular methods to contain oil spills use synthetic materials and chemicals, which can be costly and just as dangerous to environment. So, it’s worth exploring eco-friendly ways to clean up the ocean and other waterways.

Asylum is one way that refugees come to America. If you’ve already fled your home country for fear of persecution, and come to the United States, but don’t have refugee status, applying for asylum is the next step you take. It’s a small subset of the American immigration system, but it’s the mechanism behind so much of the news about border. 

Families recently separated from their children at the border came seeking asylum. People fleeing from Honduras, Guatemala, and El Salvador — an  area known as the Northern Triangle — come to the United States seeking asylum. To even get a hearing before an immigration judge, potential asylum-seekers have to prove that they have what’s called “credible fear” of returning home.

Subscribe to our channel! http://goo.gl/0bsAjO

The number is a relatively new invention in the history of humans. And that is because zero isn’t intuitive for our brains to grasp. It has to be learned. 

But how we seized zero and forged it into a tool is still a mind-bending mystery.

New research suggests the ability to fathom zero may be more widespread than previously thought in the animal kingdom. Australian scientists were able to teach bees to recognize zero as a quantity less than one, a task that confounds most human children under the age of 6. The result is kind of astounding, considering how tiny bee brains are. 

Watch the video above to learn how scientists taught bees to recognize zero.

Subscribe to our channel! http://goo.gl/0bsAjO

When Francis Scott Key attached his poem about the War of 1812 to a popular British song called ""To Anacreon in Heaven,"" he kicked off over 200 years of painfully bad singing by patriotic Americans. The Star Spangled Banner became the official national anthem of the United States in 1931, but it had been used by the Army and Navy for decades before that and was popular from the start. One big problem? The melody wasn't exactly written for the masses, but for trained soloists. 

Commentators pointed out early on that it was exceedingly difficult for most people to sing, suggesting that ""America the Beautiful"" might be a better alternative. Critics have noted that the music requires a uniquely wide vocal range, it's full of tricky intervals, and the lyrics are confusing and uninspiring. 

But if you look at the national anthem as a sport, where we get to watch performers at the top of their game tackle the gauntlet that is the Star Spangled Banner, you may come to appreciate it. In this video, we debate whether the difficulty of the Star Spangled Banner is a feature or a bug for a national anthem.

It was even the official typeface of the Academy Awards for a while. In movie poster design, if you want to make a film look official, you use Trajan. So how did that happen?

Subscribe to our channel! http://goo.gl/0bsAjO

Take a look at the US Constitution and you’ll find that the president has fairly broad power to pardon individuals accused, charged or convicted of crimes against the federal government.

President Trump’s use of pardons early in his presidency, some believe, sends signals to his allies that Trump is willing to pardon them if they’re convicted of a crime in one of the several investigations surrounding the 2016 elections. The president has also repeatedly claimed that he could even pardon himself.

So what are the checks to a US president’s pardoning power and what does the Constitution have to say about this sort of self-serving pardoning?

Subscribe to our channel! http://goo.gl/0bsAjO

When people clean out their fridge, they look at whatever date is on the label and throw it in the trash if it’s past that date. But the chances are that you’re throwing out tons of perfectly good food because date labels on food are often really confusing.

Food labels can mean many different things and often don’t give you any indication of whether the food is safe to eat or not. Many people assume that they’re federally regulated, but baby formula is the only product required to have consistent date labels. For everything else it’s up to the states to decide.

This creates a confusing state-by-state patchwork of labels with everything from “use by” to “freshest before” to “sell by” to “packaged on.” 

And all this confusion causes us to waste tons of food every year. All the uneaten food waste costs Americans over $200 billion each year, and two thirds of that comes from households.

If we came up with a unified, easy to understand date label system we could save money, food, and help the environment, all just by changing how we put date labels on the things we eat.

In this episode of Vox Almanac, Vox’s Phil Edwards puts forth a theory about terrible American men’s soccer.

There are a lot of reasons Americans suck at soccer - but if you look at the history, you’ll find a surprisingly compelling explanation for why American soccer never took off. In the 1920s, soccer was a surprisingly successful sport in the US, with massive matches and a robust league. What went wrong?

American soccer and English football first diverged in the 1800s, when American colleges like Harvard and Yale started playing a more rugby-like game. But America quickly caught up with soccer in the 1920s, attracting large crowds and even stealing away European players.

Then the soccer wars happened. Constant battles in the 1920s between the ASL - American Soccer League - and USFA — United States Football Association — carved up American soccer’s cash, fans, and talent. By the time the depression hit, American soccer was so weakened that it couldn’t rebound as well as European and South American soccer culture did. The subsequent half-century of sports build up gave Americans a permanent handicap when it came to building a robust soccer culture.

It’s a theory — but the success of the US Women’s National Team bears out the idea that something is specifically wrong for the men. And it just might be the case that 1920s soccer wars are the reason.

Islamist terrorist groups have found a new home and it's not in the Middle East -- it's in Africa. Specifically, the Sahel, a band of territory in West Africa between the Sahara desert and the savannah. 

Since the early 2000s, Islamist extremist groups have increasingly strengthened their base here -- training fighters, raising money, and launching a massive number of attacks. 

Some are linked to al-Qaeda and other Islamic State. This is throwing these already weak countries into crises and making the region one of the most dangerous in the world.

Read ProPublica reporter Ginger Thompson’s article here: https://www.propublica.org/article/children-separated-from-parents-border-patrol-cbp-trump-immigration-policy

And listen to the full audio clip at ProPublica’s YouTube channel here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PoncXfYBAVI&t=70s 

In April 2018, the Trump administration and Attorney General Jeff Sessions instituted a “zero tolerance” policy on undocumented immigration. Undocumented migrants and asylum seekers detained at the border now face immediate criminal prosecution, often before their asylum claims can even be processed. Thousands of children and other migrants are now being held in detention centers operated by US Customs and Border Protection, where they await trial.

A backlash against this policy is growing, with conservatives and liberals alike decrying it as cruel and inhumane. Both the White House Chief of Staff John Kelly and Sessions have explicitly cited the policy as a preemptive deterrent to undocumented migration, though the administration has since backtracked on that message. 

We want to help shed light on this. Has your family been separated at the US–Mexico border? Are you a worker at a detention center, or do you aid families who have been affected? Tell us more at border@propublica.org or 347-244-2134.

When you think of a soccer ball, you probably imagine a classic black-and-white paneled ball. It’s known as the Telstar ball, and it was created thanks to TV.

The 1966 World Cup in England  was broadcast live across the globe and it was at this point that television became a huge part of the sport. Thanks to the BBC, it was seen by four hundred million people. But spotting the ball was a bit challenging.

Back then, soccer balls looked more like reddish-brown volleyballs. And on black-and-white TVs, it didn’t really stand out from the green field. 

By the 1970 World Cup, the soccer ball had changed to that classic Telstar. The contrasting panels made it stand out on TV. Plus, the players loved it because the 32 panels brought the ball closer to an actual sphere. 

This year’s World Cup ball is called the Telstar 18, a nod to the original design. While the panels have changed to just six propeller-shaped pieces to make the ball even more spherical, the black-and-white checkered design is back.

Subscribe to our channel! http://goo.gl/0bsAjO

Ever notice the first step for baking a cookie is almost always to preheat the oven to 350 degrees? 

Even when you’re baking something else, an oven with a digital temperature reader typically defaults to 350. What’s so magical about this number and why is it that so many recipes call for it? 

I spoke with longtime pastry chef and Institute of Culinary Education creative director Michael Laiskonis and found that – as with most “magical” things – it’s actually science.

Tariffs can be used as a useful tool to protect domestic industry or to serve as a punitive measure against another country. But President Trump’s bluster and threats of imposing tariffs on foreign imports to the US have raised the specter of a trade war with China, and more recently, Mexico. 

The “weapons” used in a trade war are the stuff we use everyday — the food we eat, the cars we drive to work and the computers we use. If a trade war can have such a pervasive impact on our daily lives, why would a country choose to engage in one? And what even is a trade war anyway?

In this episode of Vox Almanac, Phil Edwards explores the surprising history behind sitcom lighting.

Karl Freund was the genius cinematographer behind Metropolis, the silent film classic. But then he designed the set for I Love Lucy - the first of the multicam, laugh-track heavy sitcoms. Today, they look bland, but it wasn’t always that way. But at the time, Freund had a good reason to tackle the challenge.

These lighting techniques are still in use today on sitcoms like Friends, the Big Bang Theory, and other multi-camera hits. What looks generic to our eyes was, at one time, the result of an artist who made the impossible look easy.

Subscribe to our channel! http://goo.gl/0bsAjO

Health organizations warn that continual exposure to noise levels above 70 decibels can potentially damage your ears. And yet we are routinely exposed to noise much louder than that in everyday situations.

Our world is increasingly noisy and our bars, restaurants, gyms, and streets all produce decibel levels that can cause harm to our hearing in mere minutes. 

Hearing loss is incredibly common and is the fourth highest disability worldwide. One in four American adults shows signs of noise-induced hearing loss, and the problem is only going to get worse.

While hearing damage is irreversible, it's also completely preventable. Watch for tips on how to protect your ears even in incredibly loud environments.

Subscribe to our channel! http://goo.gl/0bsAjO

Scientists have directly observed sea level rise since the late 18th century. And as they forecast the next 20, 50, and 100 years, sea level rise will continue to accelerate at an alarming rate. That rise won’t just threaten homeowners on the coast -- it will also impact the critical infrastructure that supports many of our largest cities.

While sea level rise is often phrased as an issue of concern in the future, we can already see some of the implications. Many coastal communities have witnessed a sharp uptick in flooding, during lunar king tide periods. Other places are forced to consider what life might be like as the land they currently occupy goes underwater.

The invention of the CRISPR gene editing tool has injected new life into a line of research called gene drive. Gene drives use selfish genetic elements to spread a modification through a wild population.

Researchers have proposed using gene drives against agricultural pests and invasive species, but the most urgent application is against vector-borne diseases like malaria, which kills hundreds of thousands of people every year, mostly in sub-Saharan Africa.

We talked to the scientists working on this revolutionary approach to disease eradication to find out how it works and how long it might take to deploy a technology like a gene drive against malaria.

Despite spending more per capita on health care than any other country, the U.S. has the highest rate of deaths related to pregnancy and childbirth in the industrialized world. But what makes maternal healthcare in other affluent countries look so different than the U.S.? Among other things, midwives. Midwives in the U.S. participate in less than 10 percent of births. But in Sweden, Denmark and France, they lead around three quarters of deliveries. In Great Britain, they deliver half of all babies, including all three of Kate Middleton’s. So if the midwifery model works for royal babies, why not our own? Check out the video above to find out how midwives have been at the center of a culture war that’s deeply rooted in race and class in America.

In 2016, more than 2.2 million couples got married in America, but more than 800,000 got divorced. Cheating and breakups cause grief and heartache every day. Yet some historians and evolutionary biologists say monogamy is a relatively new, self-imposed system. Their evidence suggests humans lived without it for more than 250,000 years. And we only started marrying for love in the 1700s.

So if monogamy is so hard, why do most of us, all around the world, make it a central goal of our lives?

Vox tackled this question in the first episode of our new show with Netflix, Explained, which premieres today! We’ll have new episodes every Wednesday, on topics ranging from monogamy to gene editing to the racial wealth gap to K-pop and more.

Over the course of her 63-year reign, Queen Victoria strategically planned marriages to place her descendants in royal families all over Europe. In doing so, she created one of the most remarkable royal families in history. 

By the early 19th century, Europe had been at war for decades. After the French Revolutionary and Napoleonic wars killed millions, European leaders came together to restore peace by reshaping major states for a new balance of power. Great Britain went on to become one of the strongest states. And years later, Queen Victoria and her husband Albert came up with a plan to maintain that political power — they married their children to monarchs across Europe. By the 1880s Queen Victoria’s children were in several important branches of Europe’s monarchies. 

The royal unions didn't play out as Queen Victoria planned, but she continued to make more matches anyway. She had 42 grandchildren, and these 7 ended up on royal thrones. Her grandchildren would end up on the thrones of Britain, Russia, Germany, Romania, Norway, and Spain leading up to the most destructive war Europe had ever seen.

If you listen to the first few seconds of Bruno Mars’ “Finesse” (hint: listen to the Cardi B remix) you’ll hear a sound that immediately creates a sense of 80s hip-hop nostalgia. Yes, Cardi B’s flow is very Roxanne Shante, but the sound that drives that nostalgia home isn’t actually from the 1980s. 

Robert Fink and the inventor of the Fairlight CMI, Peter Vogel, help me tell the story of the orchestra hit - a sound that was first heard in 1910 at the Paris Opera where the famed 20th century Russian composer Stravinsky debuted his first hit, The Firebird.

Subscribe to our channel! http://goo.gl/0bsAjO

Antonio Stradivari is generally considered the greatest violin maker of all time. His violins are played by some of the top musicians in the world and sell for as much as $16 million. For centuries people have puzzled over what makes his violins so great and they are the most scientifically studied instruments in history. I spoke to two world class violinists who play Stradivarius violins as well as a violin-maker about what makes Stradivari so great. 

Special thanks to Stefan Avalos for the Stradivari research footage.

Subscribe to our channel! http://goo.gl/0bsAjO

Trump and Nixon are similar in a lot of ways: they both faced major FBI investigations, were accused of obstructing justice, lashed out at the media, and oozed raw sexual charisma. Some pundits look at those similarities and assert that, like Nixon, Trump will also face impeachment.   

But Nixon never had Fox News. As trust in mainstream media has collapsed over the past 40 years, the amount of conservative media has exploded. And sources like Fox News have spent months casting doubt on the FBI and the Mueller special investigation. 

Without a uniting narrative in the media, it’s unlikely Trump will face impeachment or that Republicans in Congress will be the ones to hold the president accountable for his actions, regardless of what Mueller ultimately finds.

Subscribe to our channel! http://goo.gl/0bsAjO

Electricity is incredibly difficult to store, so grid operators have to generate it at the exact moment it is demanded. In order to do this, they create incredibly accurate models of the total electric loads, that is how much energy will be consumed on a given day. But as utilities started to produce more energy from renewable sources like solar, the models started to shift as well.

California researchers discovered a peculiarity in their state’s electric load curves, that started to look more and more like a duck. And that duck shaped chart highlights the greatest challenge to solar energy growth in the US.

Vox writer David Roberts has been covering the issue for a few years now. You can read some of his past explainers on the duck curve, and its solutions at the links below:

Subscribe to our channel! http://goo.gl/0bsAjO

Presidents give hundreds of speeches, but, for better or worse, Americans tend to remember just a few one-liners. For George Herbert Walker Bush, the 41st US president, that line was his pledge at 1988 Republican National Convention when he accepted the nomination.

“Read my lips. No. New. Taxes.”

The crowd roared in approval, but their cheers were short lived. That’s because when Bush took over the Oval Office, he inherited the consequences of his predecessor Ronald Reagan’s supply-side or “trickle down” economics: massive budget deficits. And in 1990, Bush broke his promise and raised taxes.

Bush was a traditional “country club” Republican, whose relatively moderate economic and social beliefs contrasted with more right wing conservatives that had supported Ronald Reagan. So when he lost to Bill Clinton in 1992, Reaganites abandoned a moderate, bipartisan approach to politics and the Republican Party has moved further to the right ever since.

Subscribe to our channel! http://goo.gl/0bsAjO

President Trump recently signed into law a set of controversial bills intended to make it easier to cut down on illegal sex trafficking online. Both bills — the House bill known as FOSTA, the Fight Online Sex Trafficking Act, and the Senate bill, SESTA, the Stop Enabling Sex Traffickers Act — have been hailed by advocates as a victory for sex trafficking victims.

But the new law pokes a huge hole in what is generally seen as one of the most important pieces of internet legislation ever created, Section 230 of the 1996 Communications Decency Act. Without this clause exempting websites from liability for the actions of their users, most websites simply couldn’t afford to exist Internet freedom advocates argue that this could lead to further eroding of an open internet — and puts sex workers on the front line.

We don’t often think about audio when we watch sports on TV, but it’s a huge part of the experience. We spoke with several A1 audio engineers who mix the sounds of sports to learn more about what it takes to capture the crack of the bat and the swish of the net.

From the cadence of the quarterback to the sounds of skates on ice, audio mixers are tasked with getting microphones close enough to the action to gather the sounds but still out of the way of the players and the fans.

Once the microphones are set up, they handle the stressful task of live mixing all the audio for the broadcast, so that we can hear the announcers and the sounds of the game, despite thousands of screaming fans and the PA system blaring music.

In the end, if they do the job right, you’ll forget they exist.

After surviving the mass shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School, Hogg and his classmates became vocal activists in the fight for gun control. But that spotlight has made them prime targets for the right-wing smear machine: a collection of Fox News hosts like Laura Ingraham, conservative pundits, conspiracy theorists like Alex Jones, Twitter provocateurs, and YouTube commentators who piled on to the teens in the wake of the shooting. 

Rather than crumbling under the pressure, they're using humor and advertiser pressure to keep their cause in the media spotlight while disarming their critics. In the face of intense media attention, the Parkland students are putting on a masterclass in how to deal with bullies.

Some prominent climate researchers think so. That’s because warming temperatures in the Arctic are altering the behavior of the polar jet stream, a high-altitude river of air that drives weather patterns across the globe. As the winds that propel the jet stream weaken, storms, droughts, and extreme heat and cold move over continents at slower rates, meaning bad weather can stick around for longer. 

Eli Kintisch reports aboard the Norwegian research vessel Helmer Hanssen about how changing conditions at the top of the world could be impacting weather far away.

President Donald Trump’s limited strike on Syria in April is an established tactic among presidents — his predecessors from Obama through Reagan all used similar actions, with varying results.

But limited strikes that accomplish all their goals are exceedingly rare — only about 6 percent can make that claim, according to research by expert Micah Zenko. Most strikes have mixed success, at best. 

For example: Trump’s justification for attacking Syria was to send a message about Syrian President Bashar al-Assad’s use of chemical weapons. That’s the same justification he used when authorizing a limited strike on Syria one year earlier. 

Why do presidents even use limited strikes if they’re rarely effective? There is some logic to it. For one, they’re not very costly. But more importantly, these strikes generally don’t put US troops in harm's way. And well, politically, presidents have very little to lose by exercising the option. 

In fact, authorizing a limited strike can give the appearance of strength and decisiveness and can sometimes have a positive effect on approval, whether or not the strike actually achieves its intended goals.

Read more about the border wall's effect on wildlife here: http://bit.ly/2GUHzqN

When we talk about the consequences of the proposed wall at the border of the US and Mexico, we usually think in terms of people. But along the political divide are rich pockets of biodiversity, with dwindling populations of species that rely on the ability to move back and forth across the border. 

Under the 2005 REAL ID act, the Department of Homeland Security doesn't have to comply with various environmental laws that might otherwise slow or halt construction in a sensitive area. Laws like the Endangered Species Act, the Clean Water Act, the National Environmental Policy Act or the Migratory Bird Treaty Act — none of those apply to border wall construction. 

Several parcels of land, including the National Butterfly Center, a state park, and other areas in the federal wildlife refuge system — are still threatened by wall construction. It could still be years before construction starts in some of these areas — but there’s still a lot we don’t know about the full impact of barriers on biodiversity.

A good night’s rest is critical for your health, and a lot can go wrong when you don’t get enough it. Sleep deprivation can contribute to obesity, diabetes, inflammation, heart disease, and more. The minimum recommended amount for adults is 7 hours (this too can vary from person to person). But, a third of Americans are sleep deprived — and on average, Black Americans are clocking in the least amount of z’s. 

Black Americans already face steep disparities in health, and not getting enough good sleep can compound on those issues. By examining the sleep gap, and addressing the root causes, we may be able to tackle other inequalities in the US too.

From 1934 to 1954 every Hollywood movie needed to follow a strict set of guidelines laid out by the Catholic church. They included such things as barring excessive drinking, on screen nudity, and even sexual relationships between races. Enforcement was overseen by the Production Code administration, which was led by Joseph Breen. In order to ensure that the production code was followed the Catholic Church founded the Legion of Decency, a group with millions of members that threatened to boycott any movie that didn’t adhere to the guidelines. For decades every line of dialogue needed to be approved by Breen and his administration, making him one of the most powerful people in the history of cinema.

That’s what brought an international group of scientists to the Barents Sea to investigate how plant and animal life will adapt to the new normal. 

Two key factors that govern the arctic ecosystem are rapidly changing: ice and light. The Arctic is the fastest warming place on earth, and ice that used to form on the surface of the ocean is vanishing. That’s threatening species large and small that rely on it, but it’s also created an opportunity. Less ice means more light reaches the underwater ecosystem, benefiting the algae that anchors it as well as apex predators like whales and seals.

Subscribe to our channel! http://goo.gl/0bsAjO

Our lives are lived in 1 of 3 places, the home, the workplace and the “third place,” which is anywhere outside of those two.

Toward the end of the 20th century, the regional shopping mall had become that third place, the hang-out spot in suburban America. This was largely by design — an immigrant architect created the first mall in the vision that it would be a community gathering place.

The plan didn’t work out as he intended. While malls did take off, they more often than not couldn’t quite catch on as ideal “third places.” But with an estimated 25% of shopping malls expected to close in the next five years, there’s an opportunity  to re-examine where Americans spend their time and what could be the next iteration of the third place.

China's Belt and Road Initiative is the most ambitious infrastructure project in modern history. It spans over 60 countries and will cost over a trillion dollars. The plan is to make it easier for the world to trade with China, by funding roads, railways, pipelines, and other infrastructure projects in Asia and Africa. China is loaning trillions of dollars to any country that's willing to participate and it's been a big hit with the less democratic countries in the region. This makes the BRI a risky plan as well. But China is pushing forward because its goals are not strictly economic, they're also geopolitical.

In 2017, hackers Rick Rolled a voting machine in Las Vegas. Even though the machine was out-of-date and the demonstration didn’t replicate real-life conditions, the stunt brought national attention to an election crisis that has been building ever since the “hanging chad” fiasco that occurred during the 2000 Presidential election recount.

In her story on American election security, ProPublica’s Kate Rabinowitz revealed that many state and local election officials are suffering a funding crisis. Without the money needed to maintain and update electronic voting machines, officials are having to make do with equipment that was manufactured in 2008 or even earlier. At that time, most machines had recently been replaced thanks to the 2002 Help America Vote Act, but few have been updated since. 

By isolating machines from the internet and keeping them in secure locations, officials are able to reduce the threat of widespread hacking, but the machines are plagued with more mundane technical problems that states have been slow to address and could have major consequences for future elections.

On the bright side, the omnibus spending bill that was passed in March 2018 allocated $380 million dollars for state election officials to update their voting infrastructure. Whether that money is actually provided and how it will be spent, however, remains to be seen.

These leaves actually have an originating myth courtesy of the writer Vitruvius, crediting Callimachus for the Corinthian column design. The acanthus leaves on the column have remained consistent over millennia, and, over time, have come to represent more than just a sturdy plant.

They’re on display in this video at the National Arboretum, where columns that used to sit on the United States Capitol have been relocated. These striking columns aren’t just a historical record — they’re a symbol of how Corinthian design and acanthus leaves manage to endure over time.

If that has you upset about your appearance, you’re not alone: in 2017, 55 percent of facial plastic surgeons reported seeing patients who wanted surgeries to help them look better in selfies. But that concern is often due to a visual distortion effect that makes noses look wider as a camera gets closer to a subject. 

Smartphones are everywhere, and they’re playing an increasingly large role in how we perceive ourselves physically. Researchers are now trying to figure out how to design a front-facing camera that avoids that unflattering effect.

After the mass shooting at a high school in Parkland, Florida, news networks are once again focused on the debate over gun control. These debates often pit gun control activists against the National Rifle Association (NRA), which claims to speak on behalf of gun owners. But in reality, the NRA represents the interest of gun manufacturers.

The group gets millions of dollars in donations from gun companies every year, and millions more through the sale of ad space in NRA publications. That financial allegiance means the NRA is similar to organizations like the Tobacco Institute -- an industry lobbying group primarily interested in protecting their product. 

So why do news networks keep inviting them to debate gun violence?

To see how students across the country really felt about school shootings, we put out an open request for students to send us their thoughts. Here are some of their responses. 

Gun violence, particularly school shootings, ranks among the most contentious issues in America. Since the February 14, 2018 shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, FL, mass shootings have again become a staple of the news cycle.

This school shooting is distinguished from previous ones, because students around the nation have rallied to organize for safer schools. Whether that means stricter gun control, metal detectors, regulating ammunition sales, or arming teachers, remains unclear.

In the US, a nation with high rates of diseases such as obesity and diabetes , a variety of strategies - from a junk food tax to a produce prescription program - are now being tested.

There are hundreds of male condoms that have been approved by the FDA, but there is only one female condom that’s available in the US –– and you need a prescription to get it. Female condoms are almost as effective as male condoms, so why are they so hard to find?

Female condoms have been around since the 1980’s, when a Danish doctor named Lasse Hessel came up with a prototype. It was brought to the US in the 90’s under the name FC1 but the media ridiculed it, comparing it to a plastic bag.

The FC2 came out a few years later but it wasn’t marketed very well and the original stigma still stuck around. In 2017, the company that manufactures them stopped selling them in stores and changed to a prescription-only model, so you need to see a doctor to get one.

But sexual health advocates say that we should give female condoms another chance. They're the only female-initiated method of preventing STIs (including HIV) and unplanned pregnancies and many say they’re preferable for anal sex as well. 

Putting them back in retail stores and raising awareness on the marketplace could give them a second wind and increase their usage.

Subscribe to our channel! http://goo.gl/0bsAjO

Road tripping in the 20th century became an iconic American obsession, and the rising middle class was eager to travel the country on the new interstate highway system. The Green Book was a unique travel guide during this time, when segregation was practiced all over the country.

The book, which grew to cover locations in all 50 states, listed hotels, restaurants, gas stations, beauty salons, and other services that would reliably serve African Americans. The listings grew from user correspondence and a network of African American postal workers under the guidance of Victor Hugo Green, the book’s publisher.

The American road trip would go on to be an anchor in the civil rights discussion, as it highlighted the injustices and prejudice that African Americans suffered under Jim Crow. Before the Civil Rights Act outlawed racial discrimination in public accommodations, Victor Green’s booklet helped black Americans navigate their country.

Science fiction stories often explore the relationship between humans and aliens. So we often find extraterrestrial creatures entangled with relatable human features. In this video, we talk to Oscar-nominated VFX supervisor Charley Henley, and the director of SETI Research Center at UC Berkely, Andrew Siemion.

New year, new dieting craze. The ketogenic diet is the latest in popular diets in the US. It shares many similarities with the Atkins diet; it’s low-to-no carbs, some protein, and a lot of delicious fat.

The keto diet isn’t exactly new. It’s been used to treat epilepsy since the 1920s, and it’s had promising outcomes from treating Type 2 Diabetes. However, epilepsy and diabetes aren’t the only reason people give the ketogenic diet a try. It’s also used as a diet for weight loss. The diet banishes most carbs, including fruit, and opts-in for fatty foods like avocados, salmon, eggs, cheese, butter, oil, and the holy grail of fatty meats — bacon.

Unfortunately, science has not yet proven the keto diet to be the miraculous cure to losing weight, that some kept devotees claim it to be. The more extreme a diet, the harder it is to adhere to, and though the diet may be beneficial to some, that does not mean it will work for all who give it a try.

Since the start of the Syrian civil war, Kurdish people in the North have carved out an autonomous region of their own — Rojava — by fighting the Islamic State. Their militias, which form the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), have emerged as the most effective fighters against ISIS and won them a close partnership with the US. 

The ruling Kurdish Party, the PYD, has set up a democratic federation made of local governments. Their constitution claims to accept people of all ethnicities and religions and treat them as equals. One of its central tenets is equality of men and women. In fact, the all-female Women’s Protection Unit (YPJ) militia fights alongside the SDF, and they’re known to be especially good soldiers. 

But the more territory the Kurds take from ISIS, the more worried Turkey gets.

Turkey has been at war with another closely linked Kurdish group, the PKK, for decades. In 2018, Turkey invaded the Syrian Kurdish enclave of Afrin, putting the country in direct conflict with the Kurds of Rojava. 

To truly understand the international conflicts and trends shaping our world you need a big-picture view. Video journalist Sam Ellis uses maps to tell these stories and chart their effects on foreign policy.

And he’s beaten the record by a lot — at 34 percent he’s more than doubled the rate of turnover of the previous record holder, Ronald Reagan. 

High staff turnover at the White House isn’t necessarily unusual. Each of the past five presidents had turnover within their staff. But the sheer number of people leaving the Trump administration is unusual. Is this cause for concern?

Method acting's foundational theory originated in the Soviet Union during the early 20th century. It was created by Konstantin Stanislavski and his peers at the Moscow Art Theater as a framework for systematically training young actors. Method acting became influential in the US in the ’30s and ’40s, pioneered by Lee Strasberg, Stella Adler, and Sanford Meisner, each of whom transformed and built on Stanislavski’s system.

Today, training in method acting is ubiquitous for aspiring actors. But at the same time, the stakes of method acting continue to rise. First popularized in the US during the 1950s by Marlon Brando's generation of Hollywood stars, method acting continues to be a consistent way for actors to push themselves in new roles. But while method acting won Leonardo DiCaprio his first Oscar for his performance in The Revenant, it's undeniable that the way method acting is promoted is conspicuously marketable. Still, it has undoubtedly led to some of the greatest performances of all time.

We interviewed a sports expert about the truth behind ""mind over matter"": http://bit.ly/2t8PzCc

Subscribe to our channel! http://goo.gl/0bsAjO

Biathlon combines competitive Nordic skiing with rifle shooting. Although biathlon is extremely popular in Europe, most Americans are unfamiliar with the sport. For many of them, the sport seems like an odd combination of physical effort and mental skill, but there’s a fascinating explanation for how biathlon came to be.

The sport of biathlon evolved over a long period of time and for much of that history it was primarily a military exercise to train soldiers for winter warfare. It all started in Norway, where a military officer decided to combine his love of skiing with his expertise in training tactics. Soon, the combination spread across Europe and national militaries started applying and developing his techniques to train their own winter warfare battalions.

In both World Wars, ski warfare played a key role in several battles—most notably during the “Winter War” between Finland and Russia in 1940. During that skirmish, Finnish troops used their ski prowess to elude and attack the Russian enemy. Although the Finns lost the battle, they were able to inflict major losses against the much larger foreign army.

Once WWII ended, soldiers returned home and began popularizing the sport of skiing around the world. Instead of using their ski skills for warfare, they turned to recreational endeavors like ski racing, skill competitions, and biathlon. During the next decade, the ski industry boomed. In 1960, biathlon was introduced as an official Olympic sport and it has continued to grow in popularity ever since.  

Although much has changed about the sport, modern biathlon still retains the unmistakable traces of its military origins. To learn what those are, make sure to watch the video above.

Every ten years, America readjusts its voting districts. Which state you live in determines a key aspect of that prospect: who draws the map?

In most states, politicians get to control that process. That can sometimes lead to political gamesmanship from both parties.

In early 2018, the state of Pennsylvania’s Supreme Court found that the latest redistricting plan set up voters with a politically biased voting map. Which made it easier for one party to win representation in the national body of lawmakers.

The implications of this discovery are significant. A new map could be a part of a shift in the balance of power in the United States.

zDbq7y20wpw,Vox,UCLXo7UDZvByw2ixzpQCufnA,Why ships used this camouflage in World War I,2018-02-27 13:00:09+00:00,"Dazzle camouflage was fantastically weird. It was also surprisingly smart.

WWII saw another kind of strange history unfold: a meme (yes, really). Watch our video on it here: http://bit.ly/2Co9DEu

Dazzle camouflage was a surprisingly effective defense against torpedoes. In this episode of Vox Almanac, Phil Edwards explains why.


World War I ships faced a unique problem. The u-boat was a new threat at the time, and its torpedoes were deadly. That led artist Norman Wilkinson to come up with dazzle camouflage (sometimes called “razzle dazzle camouflage”). The idea was to confuse u-boats about a ship’s course, rather than try to conceal its presence. In doing so, dazzle camouflage could keep torpedoes from hitting the boat — and that and other strategies proved a boon in World War I.


This camouflage is unusual, but its striking appearance influenced the culture, inspired cubist painters’ riffs, and even entered into the world of fashion. Though dazzle camouflage lost its utility once radar and other detection techniques took over from u-boat periscopes, for a brief period in time it was an effective and unusual way to help ships stay safe.

As a result, Nelsy Umanzor, a Salvadoran TPS holder, is now at risk of losing the temporary legal status that has allowed him to work and raise a family in Maryland for the past 17 years. But he won’t be giving up his status without a fight. Umanzor is lobbying congress to turn TPS into a path to residency before his status expires.

Today’s phones are hard to put down. Push notifications buzz in your pocket, red bubbles demand attention, and endless distractions sit at your fingertips. It can feel impossible to pull away from. But that’s kind of the point. When people talk about the “attention economy,” they’re referring to the fact that your time and attention are the currency on which today’s applications make money. Because apps profit off of the total time you spend on their platform, there’s a strong incentive to use psychological tricks  to keep you endlessly hooked. But it doesn’t have to be this way. Tristan Harris, who runs Time Well Spent, is working to create a world where platforms can more honestly respect their users’ time.

It may seem like the way we date is dictated by things like love and affection but it’s actually driven by something far less romantic: the economy. 

Dating as we know it didn’t really start until the Industrial Revolution when young people left farms and small towns to flock to cities for work. They got jobs in factories, bars, and restaurants and being away from their families for the first time offered them the freedom to mix and match with other young people. 

Ever since then the way single people have gotten together has been dictated by the ups and downs of the economy in the United States. We talk to Harvard’s Moira Weigel, author of “The Labor of Love: The Invention of Dating” about how our woes about dating are nothing new, they’ve been around since people starting pairing off.

Check out ProPublica’s feature story on the use of the Alford plea here: https://www.propublica.org/article/what-does-an-innocent-man-have-to-do-alford-plea-guilty

In 1987 police detectives — who’d later be made famous by David Simon, creator of “The Wire” —  used flimsy evidence to pin a burglary, rape and murder case on James Thompson and James Owens. They were both sentenced to life in prison. Then 20 years later, DNA evidence cleared each of them of the rape and unraveled the state’s theory of the crime. But instead of exonerating the two men, prosecutors dangled the prison keys, pushing them to plead guilty to the crime in exchange for immediate freedom. What prosecutors offered was a controversial deal called an Alford plea. Last year, ProPublica investigated prosecutors’ use of Alford pleas and similar deals in cases of wrongful convictions, and found they often cover up official misconduct. Check out the story of the two Jameses above to see what happened after the Alford plea was offered in their cases.

2018 Olympic medalist Adam Rippon, and music designer Hugo Chouinard helps explain how figure skaters pick their music. 

The 1932 Winter Olympics was the first time figure skating was performed to music. Today, music is an essential part of the sport and there’s a hidden strategy behind how they pick their songs. For a long time, figure skaters skated to classics like Carmen, Swan Lake, and Don Quixote. Not only because it’s great music but because of the clear story line and the dynamic characters in them. 

But this is all changing. In 2014, the ISU changed the music rules to allow skaters to skate to music with lyrics. Now with a wider range of music to choose from — some skaters like Jimmy Ma have traded in Bizet for Lil Jon. Will this be a new era of figure skating?

Watch our other skating videos, featuring Mirai Nagasu and Adam Rippon: http://bit.ly/2oGrA7N 

Subscribe to our channel! http://goo.gl/0bsAjO

In college, women’s hockey players are reporting concussions at a higher rate than male hockey players. In fact, female hockey players are reporting a higher concussion rate than nearly all sports sanctioned by the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA). In several studies, female hockey players have reported concussions more often than men’s college football, and at a rate that is comparable to men’s college wrestling and men’s college ice hockey. 

Compared to sports like women’s tennis or women’s basketball, hockey is faster, played on harder surfaces, and involves more collisions, which partly explains the high rate of concussions but doesn’t account for the fact that female athletes are reporting more concussions than male athletes who also play hockey. In fact, several surveys have demonstrated that, besides hockey, female athletes consistently report a higher concussion rate than male athletes playing the same gender comparable sport (e.g basketball, soccer, softball/baseball).

The reasons why are unclear, but this video highlights some of the plausible factors, including: gender bias, reporting bias, differences in style of play (for example, body checking is allowed in men’s hockey and is illegal in women’s hockey), hormonal differences (progesterone is of particular interest to researchers), neck strength, and differences in the structure of nerve fibers called axons. 

To help understand how these factors might influence the concussion rates, this video features interviews with University of North Carolina researcher Zachary Kerr and retired US Women’s Hockey player Josephine Pucci, who ended her career following several concussions. To hear her story of how she came back to win a 2014 Olympic Silver Medal while playing on the Harvard Women’s team, make sure to watch the video above.

In this episode of Vox Almanac, Phil Edwards explores the triple axel and why it's such a big deal. The figure skating jump is legendary among ice skaters, from Tonya Harding's 1991 triple axel to modern icon Mirai Nagasu's attempts in competition. It turns out that the physics of the triple axel makes it a uniquely difficult jump — and one worth learning about.

As a forward-edge jump, the mechanics of a triple axel requires technical acumen from skaters while they still try to maintain an artistically interesting performance. Pioneers like Midori Ito and Tonya Harding had to jump, ramp up rotation speed, and then land all while trying to look good. This effort set them apart from competitors like Nancy Kerrigan, but it wasn't easy to land a triple axel in competition.

And that difficulty might be why the triple axel endures as the pinnacle of figure skating performance — and why it's sure to light up the 2018 Winter Olympics as well.

The present conflict in Ukraine started in 2014. Today, there are 100,000 fighters stationed in the country, making it one of the most heavily militarized regions in the world. In Ukraine's east, Ukrainian forces are engaged in a struggle with Russian-backed separatists. 

A ceasefire was called in 2015, with a security zone established that was meant to foster peace. However, today the security zone remains one of the most violent places in the Ukraine. With over 10,000 deaths to date, and over 1.5 million civilians displaced, the cost of ignoring the ceasefire continues to mount by the day. And both sides are still building up their forces.

To truly understand the international conflicts and trends shaping our world you need a big-picture view. Video journalist Sam Ellis uses maps to tell these stories and chart their effects on foreign policy.

Watch how NFL rule changes made linemen gigantic: http://bit.ly/2BSOf5n

Subscribe to our channel! http://goo.gl/0bsAjO

In the past 20 years, over $7 billion in public money has gone towards financing the construction and renovation of NFL football stadiums. Owners argue that public investment in private football franchises will bring a boom of economic activity to  local economies. But this argument doesn’t hold up. In reality, stadiums and their upkeep wind up costing cities millions of dollars. 

For owners, new stadiums mean more profits. They get to host the Super Bowl, sell naming rights to other corporations, and build increasingly opulent and expensive premium seating.

For cities, nabbing an itinerant football franchise looking for a new home field can be a big political win. And residents want teams and the hometown pride that comes with it. Football teams give cities a sense of identity and they are paying more than ever for them.

New stadiums aren’t the economic powerhouses owners promise they’ll be. But as long there are more cities that want a home team than there are franchises, it looks like taxpayers are going to keep footing the bill.

Read more about Body Mass Index's flaws on Vox.com: http://bit.ly/2nxeQ2U

The body mass index, better known as BMI, is a measure of obesity that has been in use for over 200 years. It was a formula created by Belgian mathematician Adolphe Quetelet. It takes your weight (sorry my fellow Americans, everyone else is on the metric system) in kilograms divides and divides it by height in meters squared. And from this you get a number that represent your total body mass relative to your height and weight. The ranges go from underweight to obese, and one decimal point can tip you in either direction. BMI has been used to study obesity in large populations, and for the most part it’s okay for those types of studies. However, when individual health is the topic at hand, using the body mass index can make judging a person’s health a little bit trickier.

In 32 states plus DC, students of all ages can bypass brick-and-mortar schools for online charters. Most of these schools are run by publicly-traded companies, which means the profits they earn after running schools with taxpayer funds go toward paying their shareholders. These schools enroll less than 1% of American public school students right now, but the share is growing.  In their ads, these schools promise autonomy and flexibility. They appeal to students eager to escape bullies or classrooms where they feel unsuccessful. But the data show that attending these schools sets kids back academically— by a lot. And despite their poor performance, states have been slow to close these schools down.

Arianna Prothero and Maya Riser-Kositsky calculated the lobbying and campaign spending totals for K12 and Connections Academy for Education Week/edweek.org: https://www.edweek.org/ew/articles/2016/11/03/outsized-influence-online-charters-bring-lobbying-a.html

This 2015 study from the Center for Research on Education Outcomes at Stanford University is the most comprehensive nationwide look at online charters to date. Researchers there found that attending an online charter school for a year is equivalent to missing 180 days of instruction in math, and 72 days of instruction in reading: https://credo.stanford.edu/pdfs/OnlineCharterStudyFinal2015.pdf

June Ahn (NYU) and Andrew McEachin (RAND) did a similar study of Ohio’s online charter schools and got similar results. They found that even high-achieving students who attending online charters in that state ended the year significantly behind their peers in brick-and-mortar schools: http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.3102/0013189X17692999

Chances are you wouldn’t be able to recognize a biohazard even if you were looking right at one. But the biohazard symbol? It’s pretty easy to spot. Most warning icons rely on previously established objects or symbols: a general caution might use an exclamation point, and a fire warning might use an illustration of a flame. But the biohazard symbol references an idea that is much harder to picture — and in the 50 years since its invention, it has become one of the most recognizable icons on the planet. But can the meaning of a symbol like this last an eternity? A special Department of Energy project is trying to figure that out.

Mohammad bin Salman was designated as Saudi Arabia's new crown prince in June 2017. Since then, he has rapidly consolidated power and led Saudi Arabia towards some progressive reforms, such as granting women the right to drive. He also has plans to privatize certain segments of the economy, with the goal of reducing Saudi Arabia's economic dependency on oil. These changes, along with a suppression of Saudi Arabia's religious Right, could potentially begin to destabilize one of the Middle East's most powerful nations.

The problem? That feature now has the potential to be exploited to reveal sensitive data. And to make matters worse, these flawed computer chips have been around since 1995…

To investigate how audiobooks are made, we sat down with a professional audiobook narrator, Suzy Jackson, to break down her work. And to make the audiobook recording process even more apparent, Vox's Phil Edwards wrote one for her. According to Suzy Jackson, the hardest part of recording an audiobook isn't acting as different characters, it's the long hours. And random esophageal noises.

It's estimated that there are over 2 million rats in New York City alone. They often carry infectious diseases like E. Coli and Salmonella and gnaw on infrastructure, causing billions of dollars in damage every year. 

But is any of this the rat's fault? Rodentologist Bobby Corrigan says that rats can only succeed in the midst of human failure. If we were smarter mammals, better at disposing our trash and taking care of our infrastructure, then we wouldn't have to worry about rats in our cities.

There’s a new tax law in town. It passed without a single vote from Democrats in the House or the Senate, and it’s a huge windfall for the richest Americans, including President Donald Trump.

But Republicans didn’t just want any new tax law, they wanted to reform the tax code. To give the richest Americans a big tax cut while still funding the government’s essential functions, like building roads and flying fighter jets, the GOP needed to find tax revenue somewhere else. To do that, they had to start taxing income that used to be tax-free, by closing loopholes and eliminating deductions. 

If all of that sounds boring and confusing, fear not. We’ve broken it down in this video. Just don’t blame us if it leaves you craving cereal.","['vox.com', 'vox', 'explain', 'Tax reform', 'tax cuts', 'republican tax bill', 'top 1%', 'Donald trump', 'Paul Ryan', 'Mitch McConnell', 'deductions', 'tax loophole', 'tax cuts and job act', 'republican', 'gop', 'congress', 'cereal', 'berry cereal', 'paid in cereal']",none,189.0,hd,true,1505063.0,36688.0,5317.0,Friday,19

Subscribe to our channel! http://goo.gl/0bsAjO

The US war in Afghanistan has raged for 16 years, since the US invaded after 9/11, in 2001. At the onset, a centerpiece of US strategy was to rebuild Afghanistan's crumbling infrastructure. This move expedited military logistics and maneuvers, while simultaneously reigniting travel between Afghanistan's major cities. But when the US started its war in Iraq, that diverted resources and manpower from the battlefield of Afghanistan. And the Taliban didn't miss the chance.  To date, the most ambitious roadbuilding project, known as the Ring Road, has seen over $3 billion spent on its renewal. And it was never completed.

To truly understand the international conflicts and trends shaping our world you need a big-picture view. Video journalist Sam Ellis uses maps to tell these stories and chart their effects on foreign policy.

Amelia Earhart is often thought of as the first or greatest female pilot of her time. But the real reason she is seen as an aviation legend comes from a carefully executed publicity campaign starting with her transatlantic passenger flight in 1928, which launched her out of obscurity and into celebrity status. From there, she pursued an ambitious career of record-breaking and stunts in order to stay in the headlines and fund her aviation career.

It's a process that's designed to be fast - there are only a few steps. But it's still more complicated than a simple button.

The demonstrations began in Mashad, Iran's second largest cit, and have since spread throughout the country. There are multiple reasons for the protests, but the main one seems to stem from Iran's halting economy.

For the final episode of Earworm I'm digging into  N.E.R.D.'s hit song ""Lemon"" featuring Rihanna. Its sound is quintessential Pharrell: happy, energetic, and bouncy. The more I listened to it though, the more I realized that its bouncy energy was inspired by a genre of hip-hop that has rarely trickled into the mainstream – New Orleans Bounce. 

To learn more about the genre and to get the definitive answer on whether ""Lemon"" is a bounce song, I spoke with Big Freedia, a Native of New Orleans and an artist widely credited with bringing bounce music to the masses. 

Thanks so much for watching Earworm this year!

Whether you call him George Miller, Joji, Pink Guy, Filthy Frank (or Salamander Man, Safari Man, Chin-Chin, Santa's Brother, etc), one thing is clear — Filthy Frank has dominated the internet, from memes like the Harlem Shake to rants that have consistently earned millions of views. His fans even mobilized to direct our crowdsourced video to be about Frank's lore.

That lore includes characters like Filthy Frank himself, fake Frank, Pink Guy, Chin-Chin, Prometheus, Red Dick, and many others. It's been chronicled in a book about ""Francis of the Filth,"" recapped on Filthy Frank Wikias, and shown up in other YouTube videos.

The lore of Filthy Frank proves to be a complicated topic. More than listing off mythology about ""chromosomes"" and ""realms"" of the ""omniverse,"" it's a starting off point for a debate about whether Filthy Frank, and by extension George Miller, is an artist or just an offensive shock-comedian. The answer says a lot for the future of shock comedy on YouTube.

Something incredible has taken place in the past 5 years: a revolution in artificial intelligence. After decades of little progress, the combination of big data and advances in computer hardware have brought AI applications to life: from self-driving cars to home assistants to augmented reality and instant language translation. If some of these applications feel like science fiction it's because deep learning algorithms are powering a true breakthrough in machine intelligence. But with these truly impressive advances comes a great deal of hype: fears of terminator-type bots turning on humans and stealing all our jobs. In this video we sort out the fact from fiction in this very exciting field.

Subscribe to our channel! http://goo.gl/0bsAjO

A long time ago in living rooms across the US, a bizarre 98-minute Star Wars-themed variety show aired on CBS to an estimated 13 million viewers. It wasn't necessarily the first of its kind: hosts like Donny & Marie Osmond and Richard Pryor had done TV variety shows with Star Wars characters in 1977, which had helped boost box office sales. But unlike those shows, the Holiday Special featured the original film's cast. George Lucas was convinced to approve the project in order to maintain interest in the franchise until The Empire Strikes Back's 1980 release — but the special itself is a confusing mess. A crossdressing Harvey Korman leads a cooking show segment, Jefferson Starship stars in a holographic concert, and Chewbacca's dad watches some very suggestive virtual reality entertainment. But if nothing else, the Holiday Special was one of the first examples of Star Wars' expanded universe — whose influence continues to shape the today's Star Wars stories. No spoilers for The Last Jedi, from a certain point of view.

Sources:

TIME’s reporting: http://time.com/time-person-of-the-year-2017-silence-breakers
and http://time.com/5052362/time-person-of-the-year-2017-arm-cover
RAINN statistics: https://www.rainn.org/statistics/criminal-justice-system 
EEOC report (PDF): https://www.eeoc.gov/eeoc/task_force/harassment/upload/report.pdf 

Time magazine named ""the Silence Breakers"" its Person of the Year for 2017. These are the women and men who shared their stories of assault, harassment, and hostility and publicly named their alleged abusers. But the story goes beyond the magazine’s cover.

That elbow in the lower right-hand corner is attached to a young hospital worker from Texas, who anonymously reported her harassment for fear of the negative impact it could have on her and her family. It represents a much larger contingent than the women on the cover: the silence keepers.

Sexual harassment and sexual assault are both underreported. A government study by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission found that about 70 percent of harassment is never reported. The same report aggregated a study that found when people did report harassment, about 75 percent of faced some sort of retaliation for doing so.

The Rape, Abuse & Incest National Network (RAINN) studied the underlying reasons people don’t report, and, unsurprisingly, the above statistics are connected. According to RAINN, the No. 1 reason people don’t report their abuse and harassment is because they’re afraid of the repercussions.

Time has made it a point to recognize the courage of the “Silence Breakers,” but it’s important to remember why their actions were brave: because there are far more people remaining silent, who feel that they don’t have the option of speaking up.

In many cases, automation is changing the workforce faster than we can keep up. Manufacturers say they expect to have millions of unfilled positions. Adapting apprenticeship programs could help close the expanding wage and skills gaps by giving people another option for job training.

65 million years ago, a large asteroid collided with Earth near present-day Chicxulub, Mexico. The impact was a climactic event that likely contributed to dinosaur extinction. Today, Earth remains vulnerable to asteroid collisions. In recent history, space rocks have landed in The United States, Russia, and elsewhere. In the event of a potential asteroid collision, NASA has developed several options for dealing with the threat. Researchers at NASA’s Center for Near Earth Object Studies and Jet Propulsion Laboratory have proposed using blunt force, weaponized deflection or a theoretical tool called a gravity tractor to deflect impact. In addition to developing contingency plans, NASA scientists are also searching the sky for future asteroid threats.

There's a halo of reverence around J Dilla, a producer and beatmaker from Detroit who made some of the most fascinating and influential beats in hip hop history. Before his early death in 2006, J Dilla worked with countless artists and producers - from Erykah Badu and Janet Jackson to Busta Rhymes and Madlib - and developed an off-kilter style of rhythm and sampling that transcended the machine he used to create music, the Akai Midi Production Center, otherwise known as the MPC.

5. Nepal & The Himalaya (https://youtu.be/ECch2g1_6PQ)
6. Spain & Morocco (https://youtu.be/LY_Yiu2U2Ts)

The sixth and last Vox Borders episode deals with a border between Morocco and Spain. The journey to asylum is never easy. And perhaps no one knows this better than would-be African migrants to the European Union. In North Africa, on the border of Morocco, there's a Spanish town called Melilla. It's technically Europe.

So undocumented migrants and refugees, asylum seekers, wait in limbo for a chance to scale the fence and apply for asylum in Europe. It's the first of many, many hurdles. And it's a tall one.

In this episode of Vox Almanac, Phil Edwards explores the history of Technicolor: both the technology and the company. Many people recognize Technicolor from The Wizard of Oz, but the technology existed long before then. Two strip Technicolor and three strip Technicolor both revolutionized the film industry and shaped the look of 20th century film.

But Technicolor also influenced movies through its corporate control of the technology. People like Natalie Kalmus shaped the aesthetic of color films, and directors redesigned their sets and films based on the Technicolor look that the company — and viewers — demanded.

Though the process we traditionally recognize as Technicolor is no longer in use (the company does continue), the look remains influential even today.

Americans don't drive up the price by consuming more health care. They don't visit the doctor more than other developed countries:
http://international.commonwealthfund.org/stats/annual_physician_visits/

But the price we pay for that visit - for a procedure - it costs way more:
http://static1.squarespace.com/static/518a3cfee4b0a77d03a62c98/t/57d3ca9529687f1a257e9e26/1473497751062/2015+Comparative+Price+Report+09.09.16.pdf

The price you pay for the same procedure, at the same hospital, may vary enormously depending on what kind of health insurance you have in the US.

That's because of bargaining power. Government programs, like Medicare and Medicaid, can ask for a lower price from health service providers because they have the numbers: the hospital has to comply or else risk losing the business of millions of Americans.

There are dozens of private health insurance providers in the United States and they each need to bargain for prices with hospitals and doctors. The numbers of people private insurances represent are much less than the government programs. That means a higher price when you go to the doctor or fill a prescription.

Uninsured individuals have the least bargaining power. Without any insurance, you will pay the highest price.

Subscribe to our channel! http://goo.gl/0bsAjO

When designing urban spaces, city planners have many competing interests to balance. After all, cities are some of the most diverse places on the planet. They need to be built for a variety of needs.

In recent years, these competing interests have surfaced conflict over an unlikely interest: purposefully uncomfortable benches. 

Enter the New York City MTA. They’ve installed 'leaning bars’ to supplement traditional benches & save platform space. But designs like this carry an often invisible cost: they rob citizens of hospitable public space. And the people who experience this cost most directly are those experiencing homelessness.

A few notes of thanks:

First to Historian A. Roger Ekirch who kindly got me up to speed on the expansion of streetlights in historic western city districts.

Another thanks goes to author Veronica Harnish, who outlined some of the pitfalls that people experiencing homelessness face when choosing between sleeping rough or utilizing emergency shelters. You can read her blog here: http://car-living.blogspot.com/

A third thank you goes to the staff at the Unites States Interagency Council on Homelessness — they supplied the map in this video, as well as some aggregate statistics of the United States homeless population. Those numbers come from a variety of annual ‘Point-In-Time’ counts. The 2018 event will take place in late January, and the process depends on volunteers — so if you'd like to participate, you can find your local organizer here: https://www.hudexchange.info/grantees/find-a-grantee/?state=&program=on&coc=on&params=%7B%22limit%22%3A20%2C%22sort%22%3A%22%22%2C%22years%22%3A%5B%5D%2C%22searchTerm%22%3A%22%22%2C%22dir%22%3A%22%22%2C%22grantees%22%3A%5B%5D%2C%22state%22%3A%22%22%2C%22programs%22%3A%5B3%5D%2C%22coc%22%3Atrue%7D##granteeSearch

Subscribe to our channel! http://goo.gl/0bsAjO

It’s easy to imagine that the jobs of the future, if they even exist, will all revolve around technology. But it turns out, the jobs that are least likely to succumb to automation are those that involve building human relationships. The healthcare field is a prime example— nurses, physician assistants, and physical therapists have higher-than-average salaries and major expected job growth. These fields share something else in common— they’re dominated by women. Despite the erosion of traditionally “masculine” fields like manufacturing, men just aren’t taking these high-paying, in-demand healthcare jobs in the numbers you’d expect. For decades, nursing in particular has been considered “women’s work,” in part because it’s assumed that women, more so than men, have a kind of innate capacity for caring and empathy. But men in nursing say this mindset is holding us back. For them, caring and empathy are stills that can be developed, not traits someone is worth with or without based on their gender.

Subscribe to our channel! http://goo.gl/0bsAjO

Some cities in Europe are undergoing a fascinating transformation: they’re getting rid of all of their road signs.  That’s thanks to a design concept called “shared space,” where urban planners drastically lessen the presence of traffic lights, signs, and barriers, encouraging all forms of transportation to share the road.  There’s evidence that drivers often totally ignore road signs, so the heightened risk forces commuters to remain on high alert as they pass through an intersection, in theory leading to safer travel. But by stripping cities of their traditional traffic control systems, they leave disabled residents in the dark — and that’s sparked a powerful debate of how to balance ease of movement with all residents’ needs. 

This is one of a series of videos we're launching in partnership with 99% Invisible, an awesome podcast about design. 99% Invisible is a member of Radiotopia.

For the first time ever in 2014, the U.S. recorded more undocumented migrants from Central America than from Mexico. In particular, 52,000 unaccompanied children were detained between October 2013 and June 2014. With what seemed to be a looming humanitarian crisis to deal with, the Obama administration enlisted the help of Mexico, and President Enrique Peña Nieto's administration. 

Together, they launched the Southern Border Program initiative: the U.S. provided funding, equipment, and training to Mexico in exchange for a crackdown along Mexico's southern border. After all, many would-be migrants from Central America to the U.S. must pass through Mexico first. 

This policy worked for a few years, but levels of undocumented migrants are on the rise again. And the mounting human costs make it increasingly difficult to call a success.","['vox.com', 'vox', 'explain', 'mexico', 'usa', 'immigration', 'illegal immigration', 'undocumented migrants', 'us mexico border', 'us mexico border wall', 'documentary', 'travel', 'south america', 'latin america', 'honduras', 'guatemala', 'el salvador', 'gang violence', 'refugee', 'border', 'wall', 'border crossing', 'undocumented', 'illegal', 'liberal', 'border wall', 'immigrants', 'conservative', 'border patrol', 'trump', 'united states', 'patrol', 'president trump', 'trump wall']",none,887.0,hd,true,3548501.0,57524.0,4217.0,Tuesday,34

The promise of self-driving trucks will radically reshape one of America's most common jobs. There are 3.5 million professional drivers in the US, all of whom may face job displacement in the autonomous future being developed by companies like Otto, Daimler, and Tesla. But before robots take the wheel entirely, there will be a long period where truckers and artificial technology split the responsibilities of the work. The first big step toward that future comes in the form of the electronic logging device, a dashboard monitor that tracks speed, location, and a driver's schedule, and reports it to an employer or a third-party monitoring service. It has a lot of truckers worried.

On November 14th 2017,  Zimbabwe military troops drove tanks into the capital city, Harare. They patrolled the streets, blocked access to government buildings, and took over the state television station to insist….
This is not a military takeover of government. 

Once praised as a war hero, Robert Mugabe helped Zimbabwe win independence from Great Britain in 1980. He became president under Zimbabwe’s new constitution with the support of the people. 

But soon, he digressed into a repressive dictator.

He secured his power through aggression and threats, there have been reports of  state-sponsored torture and killings.

And even though Zimbabwe is technically a democracy, there’s evidence Mugabe rigged elections in his favor. 

Now that Mugabe is 93 years old, and reportedly in poor health, the fight for political influence is more important than ever.

And it’s caused a split in Mugabe’s own party, the ZANU-PF.
On one side we have the old guard lead by Mugabe’s sacked vice-president Emmerson Mnangagwa. Like Mugabe, he fought for Zimbabwe’s independence and has a checkered past that includes human rights abuses against political opponents and ethnic minorities.

Rihanna’s new makeup line Fenty Beauty has been an instant success — and it’s not only popular because Rihanna’s name is attached to it. Fenty Beauty carries a wide range of foundations — 40 to be exact — which has the beauty industry shook. Cosmetics and the beauty industry as a whole, has a long history of creating products that did not match deeper-toned people of color. There are a number of factors that have lead many mainstream beauty companies to having a narrow selection for people of color — and not all of those reasons are rooted in product development. With Fenty Beauty, Rihanna is showing the industry that it’s worth investing money and time into creating nuanced products beyond the ranges of ivory, beige, and tan.

Recent advancements in artificial intelligence and robotics have commentators worrying about the coming obsolescence of the human worker. Some in Silicon Valley are even calling for a basic minimum income provided by the government for everyone, under the assumption that work will become scarce. But many economists are skeptical of these claims, because the notion that the the economy offers a fixed amount of work has been debunked time and time again over the centuries and current economic data show no signs of a productivity boom. Fortunately, we don't need to divine the future of the labor market in order to prepare for it.

Japan’s Shinkansen doesn’t look like your typical train. With its long and pointed nose, it can reach top speeds up to 150–200 miles per hour. 

It didn’t always look like this. Earlier models were rounder and louder, often suffering from the phenomenon of ""tunnel boom,"" where deafening compressed air would rush out of a tunnel after a train rushed in. But a moment of inspiration from engineer and birdwatcher Eiji Nakatsu led the system to be redesigned based on the aerodynamics of three species of birds. 

Nakatsu’s case is a fascinating example of biomimicry, the design movement pioneered by biologist and writer Janine Benyus. She's a co-founder of the Biomimicry Institute, a non-profit encouraging creators to discover how big challenges in design, engineering, and sustainability have often already been solved through 3.8 billion years of evolution on earth. We just have to go out and find them. 

This is one of a series of videos we're launching in partnership with 99% Invisible, an awesome podcast about design. 99% Invisible is a member of http://Radiotopia.fm

On October 1st Catalonia held a controversial referendum on independence. Before the vote took place, the Spanish Constitutional Courts ruled the vote illegal and sent the national guard to stop it from happening. Despite government opposition, the vote was held and clashes between voters and police ensued.

Ninety percent of the participants voted in favor of independence, but public surveys say that current support for independence in Catalonia is only 41 percent. 

Despite the contested referendum results, Catalonia has declared independence unilaterally. In response, Spain is moving to dissolve the Catalan regional government, remove its leaders from office and hold regional elections.

US intelligence agencies have confirmed that emails from the Democratic National Committee and from Clinton campaign chair John Podesta were stolen by Russian hackers. 

And now in the latest string of indictments and guilty pleas announced by the Justice Department, the evidence suggests at least one Trump adviser knew of the theft in advance, and lied about it. 

The revelations come from George Papadopoulos, a foreign policy advisor to the Trump campaign, who met with Russian sources who told him of Clinton's stolen emails, several months before they were released. His guilty plea upends our timeline of what the Trump campaign knew about the Russian hacks, and when they knew it.

But they're not Japanese citizens, or even ethnically Japanese - they're North Korean. There's about 150,000 of them living in Japan today, and they've been there for over a century.

This community has close ties with the regime in Pyongyang, which supports them financially (and vice-versa). But more importantly, Pyongyang offers them an identity, a heritage, and cultural legitimacy - things that some elements of Japanese society work to deny them.

Frances Glessner Lee's ""Nutshell Studies of Unexplained Death""  are part of a new exhibit at the Renwick Gallery of the Smithsonian Art museum. The collection is part art, part science, and part creepy peek into the world of forensic science.

These miniatures significantly advanced forensics and forensic science, but they aren't just CSI curios - they're complex, confounding works of art that manage to be morbid and beautiful at the same time.

Lee's legacy bridges both the art world and the world of crime — and you'll get a chance to see exactly how her nutshell studies work. These aren't just dollhouses — they're entire worlds worth exploring.

Its discordant rhythms and motifs sound made up on the spot by a child, but every sound and riff you hear on the album was arduously rehearsed over the course of a year by a group of young musicians who were remarkable in their own right. 

Samuel Andreyev and Susan Rogers join me on Episode #6 of Vox Pop's Earworm to breakdown why this album is such a masterpiece.

The opioid crisis is driving up the population of ""kinship caregivers"" in record numbers. As overdose totals rise, grandparents and other relative caregivers are stepping in to raise the children of addicted parents. Unlike foster care, ""kinship care"" has unique requirements that are often not recognized in a child welfare system that was designed to support non-relative foster parents. As grandparents struggle to raise children on their own, they often don't realize that there are support options available until they are told by a kinship navigator or other social service coordinator. Kinship navigators fill the void created by the lack of a dedicated social services organization for kinship families. As navigators, they help inform and connect kinship caregivers to the patchwork of various programs, grants, and other services (legal, financial, health) that they are eligible to receive. Often, however, grandparents are unaware of their existence and seek other ways to support themselves -- sometimes by attending therapy groups with other relative caregivers that are raising children of the opioid epidemic. In New York State, a Relative As Parents Program support group gathers once a month to swap stories and share advice.

Subscribe to our channel! http://goo.gl/0bsAjO

The United Daughters of the Confederacy was a significant leader of the “Lost Cause,” an intellectual movement that revised history to look more favorably on the South after the American Civil War. They were women from elite antebellum families that used their social and political clout to fundraise and pressure local governments to erect monuments that memorialized Confederate heroes. They also formed textbook review committees that monitored what Southern schoolchildren learned about the war. Their influential work with children created a lasting memory of the Confederate cause, and those generations grew up to be the segregationists of the Jim Crow Era in the South.

Note: At 5:05, a previous version of the video mistakenly covered Kentucky as a former Confederate state on the map. The error has been corrected.

The ice in the Arctic is disappearing. Melting Arctic ice means new economic opportunities: trade routes in the Arctic ocean, and access to natural resources. Because of this, the Arctic nations are now moving to expand their border claims. Russia has shown that it’s the most ambitious, using a potent combination of soft power and military buildup to advance its agenda. They’ve said the Arctic is rightfully theirs.

Haiti and the Dominican Republic share a border, and an island. But the two countries are very different today: the Dominican Republic enjoys higher quality of life for many factors than Haiti. I went to this island and visited both countries, to try and understand when and how their paths diverged. And I began to learn how those differences are playing out in the present.

In episode #5 of Vox Pop's Earworm, producer Estelle Caswell, comes to appreciate the art of repetition with the help of Colin Morris and Elizabeth Margulis. Colin is a computer scientist who created two really amazing ways to visualize repetition in song lyrics and how they've increased over the last 50 or so years. Elizabeth Margulis has dedicated her career to music research and runs the music cognition lab at the University of Arkansas. Her book ""On Repeat: How music plays the mind"" delves deep into the science behind musical repetition and explores the many ways our brains react to it.

This is the final episode in the first season of Overrated - you can learn more about it here:
https://www.facebook.com/OverratedTheShow/

Follow Phil Edwards on Facebook here:
https://www.facebook.com/philedwardsinc1/

You can read the Vox article here: https://www.vox.com/2015/9/4/9258233/granite-countertops

Granite countertops are beautiful, but aren't they a little overrated? In the past, Americans loved their formica and laminate countertops, so what changed the kitchen landscape?

It turns out that stone imports from countries like Brazil and Italy, improved means of importing and cutting granite, and a general decrease in cost made the once-elite material accessible to the HGTV-loving masses. The history of granite countertops isn't just about shiny counters, but about international trade, technology, and how trends trickle down from elites to the masses.

Is granite here to stay? Who knows — quartz may prove to be formidable competition. But now at least you won't take it for granted (yes, we knowingly passed up the opportunity to write ""take it for granite"" — classy, right?).

oQyKpOJhUKY,Vox,UCLXo7UDZvByw2ixzpQCufnA,Why Rotten Tomatoes scores don't mean what they seem,2017-10-10 16:28:31+00:00,"It’s about consensus, not quality.

Subscribe to our channel! http://goo.gl/0bsAjO

EDIT: At 2:57, a previous version of this video mistakenly featured a clip from Atonement. The video has since been updated to feature a clip of Dunkirk.

The Rotten Tomatoes Tomatometer maintains high status in today’s Hollywood. A certified fresh badge can act like a marketing tool for a film. So filmmakers are sensitive to how their work fares on the platform. But the Tomatometer number you see measures something different than quality — it measures consensus.

 Earlier this summer, some executives criticized the platform, saying that critics tanked their summer hits. Films like Baywatch, Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales, and The Mummy all performed below expectations at the box office. Hollywood needed a scapegoat. Because Fandango, one of the largest online ticket-distributors, features the tomatometer at the point-of purchase, Rotten Tomatoes seemed the perfect target for the ire of executives.

But when you look closely at how Rotten Tomatoes works, it becomes clear that the service is mainly good at measuring critical consensus, not quality. That’s due to how the Tomatometer is calculated.

To read more about how Rotten Tomatoes works, you can read this article from Alissa Wilkinson: https://www.vox.com/culture/2017/8/31/16107948/rotten-tomatoes-explainer-critics-movies-aggregation

The gap between the rich and the poor in America looks more like developing countries than other Western nations. Trump and the GOP have proposed tax plans that will give massive tax breaks to the wealthy while it remains unclear if the middle class will get a tax benefit.

Deductions give a greater proportion of tax breaks to people with higher incomes. The same charitable contribution from two different incomes will benefit the higher wage earner, because deductions give tax breaks in proportion with tax brackets. Other countries have eliminated certain tax deductions in favor of tax credits. Credits give breaks in proportion to the amount you give, not the amount you owe. 

There are two kinds of income in the US. We tax wage income at a higher rate than income earned in stocks and bonds. That means people who get their income from capital gains and stock market interest pay fewer taxes than the same income of someone who works for a paycheck.","['vox.com', 'vox', 'explain', 'trump', 'tax code', 'income inequality', 'united states tax code', 'taxes', 'charitable deductions', 'ronald reagan', 'george bush', 'bill clinton', 'republicans', 'taxable income', 'tax bracket', 'mortgage interest deduction', 'capital gains', 'income level', 'poverty', 'wealth', 'tax plan', 'GOP tax plan', 'Trump tax plan', 'Republican tax plan']",none,527.0,hd,true,3129185.0,65827.0,9754.0,Monday,24

She has covered the trials of Bill Cosby, Donald Trump, Martha Stewart, and Martin Shkreli, as well as people like the Boston Bomber Dzhokhar Tsarnaev and El Chapo. She explains what it takes to be a courtroom sketch artist and how she think that compassion is one of the key traits artists must possess.

Subscribe to our channel! http://goo.gl/0bsAjO

When a gunman opened fire on a crowd at a Jason Aldean concert in Las Vegas earlier this week, he was using a legal firearm. In the United States, semiautomatic weapons are available to the general public. Fully automatic guns are not. But there is a loophole. Gun owners can purchase a ""bump stock"" modification that takes advantage of recoil mechanics to make a semi-automatic rifle far more dangerous. And that opens up a grey area in gun control policy.

Prior to 2006, Puerto Rico's economy was held together by United States business interests. But when that tax break expired, the island's economic recession became a depression. Because Puerto Ricans are US citizens, they are allowed to travel freely between the territory and the mainland. Because of the high cost of living on the island and opportunity for higher pay on the mainland, many leave.

Mismanagement of public utilities combined with a dwindling tax base has left the island with dated infrastructure, and concerning prospects for post-hurricane recovery.

Subscribe to our channel! http://goo.gl/0bsAjO

If you listen closely enough to Radiohead and Hans Zimmer’s rework of “Bloom” for Blue Planet II, you can hear a really fascinating orchestral trick at work. They call it the “tidal orchestra” — it’s a musical effect created by instructing each player to play their notes only if the person next to them isn’t playing. The result is a randomly swelling and fading musical bed for the entire series that captures the feeling of ocean waves. It’s a captivating way to score a soundtrack for the ocean — but it also fits in with a long history of capturing randomness in music composition.

If you've ever been curious about typewriter history, the rise of QWERTY wasn't an accident. Typing and typewriters weren't always around, and the inventor of the QWERTY typewriter layout didn't know it would become the standard.

Over time, however, business reasons and typing education made QWERTY a standard across the industry and, eventually, for the vast majority of typists. Though there are exceptions to QWERTY's domination, for the most part, this keyboard layout remains the default even today.

High-speed internet service is lacking in much of rural America. The causes are complicated, but non-competitive cable markets, misguided government funding, and infrastructural obstacles have limited expansion up until now. Despite the troubles, some rural Americans are receiving internet via both wireless and wireline systems, but the internet service many receive falls short of the 25mbps up/3mbps down set by the Federal Communications Commission in 2015 during the Obama Administration. Receiving that level of service typically requires a wireline connection provided by fiber optic cable, which many rural residents don't have because the remote territories that would be served are hard to reach and require massive investments that private cable companies like Verizon, AT&T, and Comcast aren't willing to make. If service is available, it is often much more expensive than similar service in urban markets. An idea for solving the problem might be to adopt the funding model similar to the one that helped expand rural electrification during the presidency of Franklin Delano Roosevelt. At that time, the government paid local electric cooperatives willing to do the work to provide electricity in their communities. Unlike electrification, there are many models for broadband deployment, including cooperatives, but also municipal broadband, private companies and other public-private partnerships. If Trump's government plans to spend more money on rural broadband, then following the model of electrification might help correct some of the funding troubles that have plagued broadband expansion up to this point.

Watch Duck and Cover with us: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uUcQ7hESI-M
Phil Edwards on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/philedwardsinc1/

In this episode of Vox Almanac, Vox's Phil Edwards looks at the history behind one of the Cold War's more unusual legacies — the fallout shelter. Of course, any history of the fallout shelter has to include nuclear proliferation, civil defense, Presidential politics, and a turtle named Bert.

The video above serves as a condensed history of the Cold War’s fallout shelter fad, from the kookily cheerful propaganda videos to the hobbled Federal agencies that tried to administer Civil Defense. Yes, it includes the classic Cold War film Duck and Cover, in which a bomb-fearing turtle named Bert teaches kids that hiding under their desks could be sufficient protection from nuclear annihilation.
Any history of fallout shelter culture (and Cold War propaganda) becomes an indirect history of Cold War nuclear escalation, from Hiroshima-sized bombs to hydrogen behemoths. As the nuclear threat increased in magnitude, the absurdity of civil defense amped up simultaneously.
This video (and a day spend trawling the Internet Archive for darkly humorous videos) provides a more intimate portrait of Cold War paranoia as it was lived. Paired with Kenneth Rose’s comprehensive book about fallout shelter culture, it’s a look at daily life with the bomb — even when that daily life included the occasional jaunt to a thick-walled concrete bunker a few feet underground.

Many thanks to Tim Brown and TED for this interview we recorded at TED 2017.

IDEO is an international design company founded in 1991. In the beginning, IDEO designed products—the first notebook-style computer, hard drives, even the next generation (of its time) PalmPilots. Most notably, in 1980, the firm was tasked by Steve Jobs to design a more affordable mouse for the Apple Lisa computer.  By 2001, IDEO stepped away from designing products and pivoted to designing experiences. The process to solving problems, whether they be simple or complex, encompass these four steps: observing, ideamaking, prototyping, and testing. Tim Brown, CEO and president of the company, explains how human-centered design (and this four-step process) is a major key in how IDEO approaches complex challenges.

Grant Wood's American Gothic is a classic painting. But to understand its fame, you have to learn some context about how it became an icon.

When Grant Wood painting his sister and dentist in front of a house in  Eldon, Iowa, he didn't know his painting would become iconic. But American Gothic soon became the subject of countless homages and parodies. 
Wood's place in American art history is unique — and worth knowing to truly appreciate American Gothic.

In 2013, Migos made it to the Billboard Charts with ""Versace."" It was a viral hit and it put the spot light on a very unique rap flow - the triplet. The triplet, often now called the ""Migos flow"" happens when three syllables are rapped over one beat. It's now so popular that nearly every mainstream rap artists these days has used it, often to great effect. Kendrick rapped in triplets on one of the most dramatic moments of his latest album, Damn. and Chance the Rapper used triplets on the opening track of Coloring Book. This video is about where the triplet flow came from and how it's been a common tool for rappers since Three 6 Mafia and Bone Thugs-N-Harmony's debut albums in the '90s.

Phil Edwards has a chat with Franklin Leonard, the creator of The Black List, Hollywoods’ famous anonymous survey of unproduced screenplays. The Black List isn’t a guarantee that a script will be produced, however, it does give overlooked scripts a second shot of getting on the big screen. A handful of academy award- winning-films found their second chance on the Black List. And in an industry brimming with multi-year contracted sequels, and well-established franchises, the Black List survey has become one of the few places in Tinseltown where one-off scripts have a chance to make it to the big screen.

In this episode of Overrated, Vox's Phil Edwards investigates the largely unheralded business reason behind the success of Harper Lee's ""To Kill A Mockingbird.""

Harper Lee's To Kill A Mockingbird is a literary classic, but it was also a landmark book in the paperback revolution. Thanks to publishers like Penguin Books, paperbacks changed dramatically from pulp fiction and dime store novels to a a legitimate way to read great literature.

To Kill A Mockinbird's timing helped it capitalize upon that business shift and become a classic in classrooms — for business reasons as well as literary ones.

GGm0FQ6i74U,Vox,UCLXo7UDZvByw2ixzpQCufnA,What Hillary Clinton really thinks,2017-09-12 19:27:37+00:00,"Hillary Clinton’s theory of politics is unfashionable, but she doesn’t care.

Subscribe to our channel! http://goo.gl/0bsAjO

On page 239 of What Happened, Hillary Clinton reveals that she almost ran a very different campaign in 2016. Before announcing for president, she read Peter Barnes’s book With Liberty and Dividends for All, and became fascinated by the idea of using revenue from shared natural resources, like fossil fuel extraction and public airwaves, alongside revenue from taxing public harms, like carbon emissions and risky financial practices, to give every American “a modest basic income.”
Her ambitions for this idea were expansive, touching on not just the country’s economic ills but its political and spiritual ones. “Besides cash in people’s pockets,” she writes, “it would be also be a way of making every American feel more connected to our country and to each other.” 
This is the kind of transformative vision that Clinton was often criticized for not having. It’s an idea bigger than a wall, perhaps bigger even than single-payer health care or free college. But she couldn’t make the numbers work. Every version of the plan she tried either raised taxes too high or slashed essential programs. So she scrapped it. “That was the responsible decision,” she writes. But after the 2016 election, Clinton is no longer sure that “responsible” is the right litmus test for campaign rhetoric. “I wonder now whether we should’ve thrown caution to the wind, embraced [it] as a long-term goal and figured out the details later,” she writes.
What Happened has been sold as Clinton’s apologia for her 2016 campaign, and it is that. But it’s more remarkable for Clinton’s extended defense of a political style that has become unfashionable in both the Republican and Democratic parties. Clinton is not a radical or a revolutionary, a disruptor or a socialist, and she’s proud of that fact. She’s a pragmatist who believes in working within the system, in promising roughly what you believe you can deliver, in saying how you’ll pay for your plans. She is frustrated by a polity that doesn’t share her “thrill” over incremental policies that help real people or her skepticism of sweeping plans that will never come to fruition. She believes in politics the way it is actually practiced, and she holds to that belief at a moment when it’s never been less popular. 
This makes Clinton a more unusual figure than she gets credit for being: Not only does she refuse to paint an inspiring vision of a political process rid of corruption, partisanship, and rancor, but she’s also actively dismissive of those promises and the politicians who make them.

On Tuesday morning, I sat down with Clinton for an hour on the first official day of her book tour. It is a cliché that stiff candidates become freer, easier, and more confident after they lose — see Gore, Al — but it is true for Clinton. Jon Stewart used to talk of the “buffering” you could see happening in the milliseconds between when Clinton was asked a question and when she answered; the moments when she played out the angles, envisioned the ways her words could be twisted, and came up with a response devoid of danger but suffused with caution. That buffering is gone.
In our conversation, she was as quick and confident as I’ve seen her, making the case for her politics without worrying too much about the coalitional angles or the possible lines of offense. And she says plenty that can, and will, offend. In our discussion, she lit into Bernie Sanders’s single-payer plan, warned that Donald Trump is dragging us down an authoritarian path, spoke openly of the role racism and white resentment played in the campaign, and argued that the outcome of the 2016 election represented a failure of the media above all. This was Clinton unleashed, and while she talked about what happened, it was much more interesting when she talked about what she believed should have happened.

Subscribe to our channel! http://goo.gl/0bsAjO

In September of 2001, Disney was approaching final cut on Lilo & Stitch — a children's film set for release in early 2002. The climax of the film initially featured Stitch piloting a 747 through a fictional Hawaiian city. But that urban backdrop was replaced with a mountainous backdrop, and the aircraft was re-worked to look like an alien spacecraft.

The changes were informed by the shift in the mood in America following the terrorist attacks on 9/11. Disney wasn't alone in their obligation to rework content to a more appropriate tone for a nation still reeling from the attacks. Children's shows like Power Rangers, Pokemon, and Invader Zim had episodes taken off the air due to scenes where buildings and cityscapes were destroyed.

The nation had changed, and the national conversation facilitated by popular culture had changed alongside it. To trace these developments in greater detail, read this write-up from Lindsay Ellis: https://www.vox.com/2016/9/9/12814898/pop-culture-response-to-9-11

TJ5C7TsBsao,Vox,UCLXo7UDZvByw2ixzpQCufnA,Why a storm surge can be the deadliest part of a hurricane,2017-09-09 12:17:14+00:00,"It can start before a hurricane even makes landfall. 

Subscribe to our channel! http://goo.gl/0bsAjO

Storm surge, or coastal flooding, tends to be the deadliest aspect of hurricanes. As wind from the storm pushes water onshore several feet above the normal tide, it can trap people in their homes, wash away entire houses, and make rescue missions harrowing and slow.

In the US, the Eastern and Southeastern coastlines are among the most vulnerable areas for storm surges. Along the East Coast, hurricane Sandy produced a massive storm surge in 2012. On the Gulf Coast, places like Galveston, Texas and New Orleans have seen multiple hurricanes so they've built some infrastructure to help defend against excessive flooding. Levees, canals and seawalls are designed to stop or redirect rising water away from cities. But even those can be inadequate, when faced with an especially strong hurricane.

What really concerns experts, though, are places that don’t experience a lot of hurricanes but are still vulnerable to storm surge, like the coast of Georgia and Northern Florida. These areas have shallow water, which means sea level can rise faster and water can reach further inland making the flooding worse. But they’ve seen fewer hurricanes than the Gulf Coast and they are likely to be less prepared.

So when a major hurricane like Irma hits low-lying areas like these, the storm surge can be the first and deadliest thing headed their way.

Subscribe to our channel! http://goo.gl/0bsAjO

Wealthy, prestigious universities such as Harvard Yale, Stanford and Columbia garner billions in donations with the message of financial aid. They show off case after case of talented students from humble backgrounds reaching the top 1% after attending elite schools. The story goes that these universities aren’t just world leaders in cutting-edge research, they’re engines of upward social mobility. 

But the latest research by the Equality of Opportunity project suggests this is a myth. A study 10.8 million people on the effect colleges have at moving kids born into the bottom 20 percent of the income distribution up to the top 20 percent showed that though elite universities are very good at moving students up the income ladder, they let in very few low-income students. The problem isn’t one of financial aid, but outreach; thousands of high-achieving poor kids just aren’t applying to elite schools.

The true heroes are less selective schools that let in a large number of students from the bottom 20%. They include Cal State Los Angeles and PACE University. These schools take in the most low-income students who move to the top fifth of income in the US after graduation.

Subscribe to our channel! http://goo.gl/0bsAjO

The most consequential decision President Donald Trump made on immigration in his first year in office wasn’t about the wall, or who’s going to pay for it, or anything else he talked about incessantly on the campaign trail.

It was his decision to announce, on September 5, that his administration would be winding down the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program — a program he didn’t mention outright, that many people didn’t know about and even fewer understood.

The Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, or DACA, which has protected nearly 800,000 young adult unauthorized immigrants from deportation and allowed them to work legally since 2012. The immigrants protected through DACA grew up in the US; people might not assume they are unauthorized immigrants, and they might not have even known it themselves until they were teenagers. The program was supposed to give them a chance to build a life here.

Now, DACA is on the chopping block. Trump, under pressure to make a decision about its future before September 5 (the day a group of Republican state officials were set to sue over its constitutionality), has decided that no one new will be protected under the program — and that those currently covered will start to lose their protection and work permits on March 6, 2018.

The prospect of DACA’s demise is throwing the program into sharp relief: calling attention to the “DREAMers” who’ve been able to benefit from it, and the ways in which their lives have been changed over the past five years.

This dispatch is from the Rio Grande River, on the Texas side of the U.S. border with Mexico. I embedded with border patrol, to learn about the technology, techniques, and challenges of monitoring a section of the border with over 300 miles of river. 

Vox Borders is a new international series focused on telling the human stories that emerge from lines on the map. I've traveled to five of six border locations to produce a final set of documentaries. While I travel I'm releasing video dispatches on YouTube and Facebook, documenting my experiences in a vlog that's independent from the final Vox Borders documentaries.

Subscribe to our channel! http://goo.gl/0bsAjO

The fade out in music is one of those necessary tools in a record producers arsenal. But if you listen to today's hits it's much more likely you'll hear a song that has a hard abrupt electronic ending. Bill Weir, wrote a great piece at Slate a few years ago tracking the rise and fall of the fade out in pop music: from one of the very first fade outs created by a literal wooden door to the epic 4 minute fade out of ""Hey Jude."" In the video above he brings me through that sonic journey. 

Here's the Slate article for reference: http://www.slate.com/articles/arts/music_box/2014/09/the_fade_out_in_pop_music_why_don_t_modern_pop_songs_end_by_slowly_reducing.html

Since I've moved to the US in 2010, there's one thing that I still don't fully understand: the imperial system. Virtually every country on earth uses Celsius but America has yet to follow. Although it might not seem like a big deal, not using the metric system puts America at a great disadvantage. For example, American kids have to learn 2 sets of measurements making science education even more difficult. On top of that, American companies have to produce extra products to export to metric countries. So why does the United States still have such an antiquated system of measurement?

_0TCrGtTEQM,Vox,UCLXo7UDZvByw2ixzpQCufnA,How climate change makes hurricanes worse,2017-08-29 00:35:44+00:00,"Here's what we know about climate change and hurricanes.

Subscribe to our channel! http://goo.gl/0bsAjO

We know that humanity's carbon footprint has shifted the baseline conditions of the climate, the context in which every weather event takes place. But trying to isolate the human influence from everything else that is going on can be really hard, especially for hurricanes, or what scientists call ""tropical cyclones.""

They're super complex and the quality of the historical data we have for them isn't great. We do have physics, though. Hurricanes are driven by the transfer of heat from the sea to the air through evaporation. The storm's maximum possible wind speed, or its potential intensity, depends in part on how warm the ocean is – and of course, we're warming the ocean.

So researchers expect intense tropical cyclones to become frequent if we continue to warm the planet.

The hurricanes of the future will also be wetter. So coastal cities will face freshwater flooding from the sky paired with storm surge from the sea, which is higher now because we are also causing sea levels to rise. And that trend of wetter storms isn't just for hurricanes. Heavy precipitation events from other types of storms have been increasing in The US and should continue to increase across the country. Even in places that might see less rain over the whole year, they'll get more days with really heavy precipitation.

This comes down to basic physics too: warmer air can take up more water before it dumps it back down on us. All of this means global warming worsens floods like the kind that hit Houston. 

But it's not our destiny to hurt ourselves like this. It depends on what we choose to do now. We could rethink our infrastructure and regulations to minimize the damage, but unless we also start cutting our carbon emissions and shifting the world to clean energy, it's just going to get worse.

Venezuela was once the richest country in Latin America. It has the largest known oil reserves in the world and its democratic government was once praised world wide.

But today, Venezuela’s democratic institutions and its economy are in shambles.The country has the highest inflation in the world, making food and medicine inaccessible to most Venezuelans. 

Over the last four years, its GDP has fallen 35%, which is a sharper drop than the one seen during the Great Depression in the US. The country’s murder rate has surpassed that of the most dangerous cities in the world.

These conditions have sparked months of protests against the president, Nicolas Maduro. And it’s easy to see why: the country has become measurably worse since his election in 2013.

The modern way of burying a body, the ""casket in the ground method"" most of us are used to is horrible for the environment. It uses an incredible amount of resources, emits toxic pollutants into the air, and pumps the ground full of formaldehyde, which is known to cause cancer. It's also prohibitively expensive. The average cost of a modern funeral costs between $10,000 to $12,000.

There are a number of greener options available though. Cremation uses less resources and requires less space than a traditional burial, but isn't perfect. There are more experimental methods on the horizon such as promession and alkaline hydrolysis. 

No matter which method we choose, it's clear that we need to reform how we bury the dead.

He explains how Microsoft Paint works for him, and includes notes about his favorite artists, like Herge, Ivan Bilibin, and more. He also shows why he prefers Paint to Photoshop and Illustrator and how it created his unique artistic style. This speedpaint is a reflection of years of labor.

Here's a Spotify playlist of some of the best gated reverb songs: http://spoti.fi/2vH7ZZL

Over the past few years a general nostalgia for the 1980s has infiltrated music, film, and television. I deeply love those gated reverb drums of the '80s - you know that punchy percussive sound popularized by Phil Collins and Prince? So for my second episode of Vox Pop’s Earworm I spoke with two Berklee College of Music professors, Susan Rogers and Prince Charles Alexander, to figure out just how that sound came to be, what makes it so damn punchy, and why it’s back. 

Correction: At 2:01, a previous version of the video mistakenly said the noise gate only lets frequencies above a certain threshold pass through. We should’ve said “amplitudes” instead of “frequencies.” The error has been rectified.

At 3:45 we noted that plate reverb boxes were made using aluminum. In fact, they were usually made of steel.

Become a Vox Video Lab member! http://bit.ly/video-lab

The August 21, 2017, total solar eclipse in the US was the most-viewed totality in history and the first for a whole generation of Americans. But there is a small community of enthusiasts who have already seen 5, 12, even 30 total eclipses before. 

That's because after their first eclipse, they were hooked, and now spend all of their vacation time and spare money chasing total solar eclipses around the world, with the solar system as their travel guide. 

We interviewed 9 of these eclipse veterans to find out what totality is like, what we should expect, and whether they have advice for first-timers.

Haiti has a significant deforestation problem, driven in part by the widespread usage of charcoal for cooking in Haitian households. This practice is doubly problematic as it also raises health concerns for Haitians who burn charcoal in their homes. One initiative, spearheaded by The Nature Conservancy, is tackling this problem through the introduction of solar ovens. These ovens cook food with reflected sunlight, reducing the burden of deforestation in a sustainable way.

August 20, 2017 marks the fortieth anniversary of the launch of Voyager 2. Along with Voyager 1, NASA sent the twin spacecraft to collect data about giant planets of our outer solar system. Voyager 2 was the first spacecraft to visit Uranus and Neptune, as well as discovering many new moons orbiting both Jupiter and Saturn. In addition to collecting data, Voyager 2 was sent with a copy of “The Golden Record”: a disk containing 116 images and various audio recordings that depict human life. Should Voyager 2 ever be encountered by an extraterrestrial, the record will be a means of understanding planet Earth. Besides the collection of data and the mysteries of alien life, perhaps the most wondrous aspect of Voyager 2's mission is the distance it has traveled: nearly 11 billion miles as of late 2017. It is the second-farthest human-made object from earth (the farthest is Voyager 1) and it is currently on a one-way journey into the unknown depths of interstellar space. Unable to grasp the enormity of this distance, we made a video to try and visualize what that actually looks like.

Subscribe to our channel! http://goo.gl/0bsAjO

You’ve probably walked by them on street corners in Washington, DC: old cast-iron fixtures that definitely used to be something. Most are hollowed, while some have art installations or representations of local history inside. But what are they? And why are they all over the city?

These relics were actually crucial for urban communication before the days of the telephone. They’re fire and police call boxes, and they were installed in DC in the late 1800s.

The fire boxes, which came first, relied on a telegraph system. If you saw a fire, you would run down to the box and turn the key inside. It would send a message through underground cables to the central alarm center. The transmission matched a location on a giant map, telling the fire department where to send help.

The police boxes were used a little differently. They had telephones connected directly to the police department. The boxes were used by officers on patrol to check in from different street corners at different times to update central command, call for backup, or receive updated orders for their patrol area.

Over time, with the telephone becoming a common household technology and the invention of the 911 system in the 1970s, the boxes, which had cropped up across the country, slowly became obsolete. In DC, they were entirely abandoned as the city deemed the upkeep too expensive.

But in 2000, they found purpose again. A nonprofit organization called Cultural Tourism DC initiated ""Art on Call"" to restore the call boxes. The program encouraged local artists to turn them into neighborhood icons. So now these boxes serve the same street corners that they did more than 100 years ago.

Subscribe to our channel! http://goo.gl/0bsAjO

Starting in the late 20th century, modern streetcar proposals started rippling across municipalities in the United States. They’re touted as infrastructure carrying benefits ranging from the social to economic and the environmental. But these projects often make appearances in the news as costly, blunder-filled experiments in public policy.

Cities are willing to bet big on this technology for its potential to develop the local economy. But there is some disagreement as to whether the streetcar is driving this progress, or if it is simply the result of planning *around* the streetcar.

It’s origin dates back to the late 19th century when construction of an underground tunnel produced a tiny mound of rock that was originally named Belmont Island, after August Belmont Jr. who financed the construction project.

In the intervening years it was leased by a Buddhist spiritual group, crashed into by numerous vessels, and briefly occupied by a protesting artist.","['vox.com', 'vox', 'explain', 'new york city', 'new york', 'manhattan', 'u thant island', 'belmont island', 'tiny island', 'urban exploration', 'east river', 'history', 'canoe', 'adventure', 'animation', 'illustration', 'hand drawn', 'staten island', 'statue of liberty', 'go pro', 'queens', 'contruction', 'sri chinmoy', 'united nations', 'off limits', 'duke riley', 'funny', 'embarassing', 'fail', 'fall in river', 'fall in water', 'the big apple', 'secrets of new york', 'hidden new york', 'secrets', 'urban explorers', 'abandoned', 'documentaries', 'meal time videos']",none,236.0,hd,true,5984352.0,97519.0,2755.0,Tuesday,39

And follow Vox Earworm on Facebook for more: http://www.facebook.com/VoxEarworm

In this season opener of Earworm, I speak with Warren Lain. He's a Radiohead fan who also happens to be an incredibly talented musician and music teacher. In December 2016 he uploaded a 38 minute video to YouTube about a Radiohead song that I deeply love, ""Videotape."" 

He had been thinking about the music theory behind this seemingly simple song for the better part of a decade. The reason? “Videotape”, a slow rhythmically monotonous song, is actually syncopated. I’m joined also by Erin Barra, a professor at Berklee College of Music, who helped Warren and I explain this musical illusion. 

Warren’s video can be found right here:

Correction: At 0:18, a previous version of the video mistakenly suggested that Turkey-backed forces are fighting ISIS in the west. In fact, the Russia-backed Syrian army and its allies are fighting ISIS in the north and west. The error has been rectified.

We also want to clarify that the color coded lines that appeared in the previous version at 0:18 did not indicate a border or the frontline. The lines were meant to illustrate that ISIS was under attack on all sides. That highlight has now been removed to avoid any confusion.

Now with the loss of Mosul, the fall of the ISIS caliphate seems imminent, but what happens when ISIS is gone?

Subscribe to our channel! http://goo.gl/0bsAjO


Lyme disease is the most common vector-borne disease in the US; and climate change is helping it to spread even more. Animals such as deer, mice, squirrels, other critters in wooded area can be hosts to the bacteria, Borrelia burgdorferi, that causes Lyme disease in humans. When ticks feed off these hosts, the ticks become infected with it. And the bacteria can then be transmitted to humans via tick bites. There are numerous ways to prevent tick bites, but the best protection is vigilance.

///

Fentanyl is the latest iteration in an opioid epidemic that is claiming an increasing number of American lives. In the mid 1990s, Americans started getting hooked on prescription pills in record numbers. Many users found their way to addiction by abusing pills like OxyContin, Percocet, and Vicodin – prescription opioids that had been prescribed by medical professionals to treat pain. Hoping to stem an increasing number of opioid overdoses, the US government limited the supply of prescription pills by restricting regulations, prosecuting irresponsible physicians, and penalizing drug manufacturers. As a result, addicts had access to fewer pills so they turned to a more potent opioid: heroin. As the rate of heroin usage began climbing, the desire for even more potent opioids soon increased. Within a few years, overdoses caused by another opioid began rising: fentanyl. Three years after US heroin overdoses began rising, overdoses caused by synthetic opioids (e.g., fentanyl) began rising as well. Now, even more potent opioids, like carfentanil, are starting to be used by opioid addicts. The iterative progression of the opioid epidemic demonstrates the need for more responsible drug policy: in addition to cracking down on the supply of drugs, authorities can work to reduce the demand for opioids by providing and promoting effective addiction treatments.

Subscribe to our channel! http://goo.gl/0bsAjO

Christopher Nolan's Dunkirk is a nerve-wracking movie. Three separate storylines tell the tale of the famed World War II evacuation in a intense two hours of film. A lot of that feeling has to do with how the film's score uses Shepard tones — layered sound waves that simulate a constant ascent in tone — to create a sensation of building tension. They're a personal favorite trick of Nolan's: he's based sound effects and entire soundtracks with other composers on the auditory illusion. In Dunkirk, composer Hans Zimmer crafted his soundtrack around the effect — and it's an auditory masterpiece.

Red imported fire ants (solenopsis invicta) are native to South America and an invasive species in the United States. One of the adaptations that makes them so hardy is that they can build large structures by linking their bodies together. This is how they form rafts that can float during floods. When they're aggregated together, fire ants can be seen as a material and the Hu lab at Georgia Tech has been testing that material for years.

Haiti experienced a devastating earthquake in 2010. Seven years later, over 10,000 nonprofit organizations and $6 billion dollars of aid funding have been funneled into the country. Although there's still a desperate need for basic services such as food, healthcare, education, and shelter, questions have arisen about whether this continuous aid has become a crutch for the Haitian government. Similarly, Haitians themselves are awaking to the notion of self-determination in their country.

Become a Vox Video Lab member! http://bit.ly/video-lab

Note: This is an update of a video we published in 2015.

In this video we explain the differences between a solar and lunar eclipse and why some believe that a total eclipse of the sun is the greatest natural phenomenon of them all. 

Total solar eclipses are a big deal not because of how infrequent they are — there’s a total solar eclipse every 18 months on average — but because of how little of the Earth’s surface falls in the path of any given eclipse shadow.

The next total solar eclipse to visit the US will be in 2024. If an eclipse happens to come to your town, you’re lucky. Any given location will see a total solar eclipse only once in more than 300 years, on average. The vast majority of us will have to travel to an eclipse path if we want to see a total eclipse in our lifetimes.

Thankfully NASA has mapped every eclipse that will occur for the next 1,000 years: https://eclipse.gsfc.nasa.gov/SEpubs/5MCSE.html

Watch: Eclipse chasers tell us what it's like to witness a total solar eclipse. https://youtu.be/Xo26Or1GGWE

The next solar eclipse over the United States will be in 2024.

After that? 2045. Then 2052, 2078, and, if you’re truly blessed with longevity, a great one over Maine in 2079.

Subscribe to our channel! http://goo.gl/0bsAjO

The cities we live in are shaped by the way we get around them. Over the past 60 years, with more and more people opting to drive cars, the need for parking spaces has increased with the boom in driving. 
To accommodate that demand early on, cities and towns started requiring developers to include parking with their new buildings after World War II. These policies, known as mandatory parking minimums, set precise standards for parking spaces for each building. And these parking spaces don't come cheap.

We often think of the ocean as a quiet, peaceful place, filled with animals that don't make much noise. So when I went diving in the ocean for the first time, I was surprised at how rich the soundscape around me was: you could hear fish nibbling on coral and squid swimming past you. But more than anything, you could almost always hear the hum of a boat engine. It's part of a big problem in the ocean right now. Ship traffic noise has doubled every decade since the 1960s — and it's wreaking havoc on marine life. 

This video was made in collaboration with Twenty Thousand Hertz, a podcast that dives deep into all kinds of stories about sound. Everything from ""who's the person behind the voice on your phone,"" to ""what do other planets sound like to our ears?""

Famous for chopping off a piece of his ear in a fit and delivering it to a woman in a brothel, Vincent van Gogh is remembered for his ailing mental health and the many paintings—over 900— he created during his lifetime. Van Gogh was born on March 30, 1853, in the village of Zundert in the Netherlands. 

During his lifetime, Van Gogh’s work had little value to no value in the art world; but a century later, the first version of Van Gogh’s Portrait of Dr. Gatchet sold for $82.5 million in 1990 (around $159 million today). Van Gogh heavily financially-dependent on his younger brother Theo van Gogh. Though the relationship was strained at times, both brothers corresponded with each through hundreds of letters over the years.

Well-known paintings such as The  Starry Night, Cafe at Night, andWheat Field with Crows were created within a two-year period before his death in July 1890. It was the same wheat field Van Gogh painted in June, that’d he go to shoot himself in the chest.

Though Vincent van Gogh lived a short and destitute life, he created some of the most revered paintings today.

Every lane has a pattern. In this episode of Vox Almanac, Phil Edwards explores how they change the game.

Bowling isn’t just about a great ball and good form — if you want to understand the sport, you have to understand the lane.

Every bowling lane, including the one in your neighborhood alley, is coated with an oil pattern to protect the wood. But these patterns aren’t just for protection — the way in which oil is applied to the lane can affect the speed and direction of your ball. 

These patterns are so important that recreational bowlers and professional bowlers bowl on vastly different patterns — the Professional Bowlers Association (PBA) even classifies the patterns it uses in tournaments.

Phil Edwards met with professional bowler Parker Bohn III at his childhood bowling alley, Howell Lanes in Howell, New Jersey. He guided Phli through the complex strategy a pro bowler uses when encountering different oil patterns. Not only do they have to assess which pattern is in use, but they also have to judge how that pattern changes as the oil shifts and slides over the day. Knowing how to play a specific lane can be the difference between a title and second place.

But these patterns aren’t just for the pros — they’re relevant to recreational bowlers as well. Watch the video to see how you can use these patterns to step up your game.

News keeps breaking about Donald Trump Jr., and it's hard to keep up. So far, we know he met with a Russian lawyer who had promised him documents incriminating Hillary Clinton. In the email exchange setting up that meeting, we learned three things. First, that a person whom the intermediary called ""a Russian government lawyer"" reached out to the campaign wanting to help. Second, the intermediary specifically mentions the Russian government's desire to help Trump win the US election. And third, Paul Manafort, Jared Kushner, and Donald Trump Jr. all knew about this effort, and instead of reporting it to the FBI, they took the meeting.

48% of Americans profess to believe in ghosts, and around a quarter say that they've actually seen a ghost before. I wanted to find out if there was any proof of their existence, so I spoke with Joe Nickell, allegedly the world's only paranormal investigator who had researched reported hauntings for almost 50 years.

He says that he's never seen any evidence that would point towards the existence of ghosts. Nickell walks us through the various scientific explanations for why people think they see ghosts, including sleep paralysis, waking dreams, traumatic grief, and exposure to infrasound.

So even though there may be no evidence that ghosts exist, that doesn't mean that you might not see one.

Detroit, Cleveland, Cincinnati, and other former industrial powerhouses in the Midwest are struggling. The industries that have supported those cities have gone away, leaving them overbuilt and underpopulated. Meanwhile, coastal cities like New York and Washington, DC are overcrowded and absurdly expensive. So, why not relocate some well-paying federal jobs from the capitol area to the Midwest? Vox's Matt Yglesias explains how such a plan might work.

At the same time, the coal industry is experiencing a major downturn. But despite the current political rhetoric, it's a downturn that's been in the works for nearly 100 years. Automation, technical advances, and more recently, the rise of cheap natural gas have led to a significant drop in demand, onet that the industry may never recover from.

Roadkill harms animals, endangers drivers, and costs billions of dollars every year. In Banff National Park in Alberta, Canada, wildlife scientist Tony Clevenger and other researchers have proven that constructing overpasses and underpasses for animals decreases roadkill and improves ecological connectivity. Many animals, including deer, elk, grizzlies, moose, lynx, cougars and others, have been recorded using the structures. Although animal crossing structures have been fairly common in Europe for a few decades, there are relatively few in North America. In The United States, the crossing structures that have been built, in places like Washington State and Wyoming, were partly inspired by the research Clevenger conducted in Banff. To create even more of them, Clevenger worked with a team of experts, including ecologist Nina-Marie Lister, to organize a design competition. The competition, named ARC solutions, was held in order to generate more cost-effective crossing designs that are also sustainable and environmentally friendly. The competition generated many new models for animal crossings and Clevenger and Lister hope that highway planners will adjust their approach to structure design based on them.

Republicans in the Senate are doing their best to repeal and replace Obamacare, as they've promised to do for years. But the bill they put out this week would hurt many of the people they vowed to protect, especially women. The bill slashes Medicaid funding and defunds Planned Parenthood-- both of which would take away prenatal, maternity, and reproductive care from millions of women. These cuts couldn't come at a worse time-- the United States is one of the only developed countries in the world with rising maternal death rate, with more than half of childbirth deaths coming from easily preventable conditions that would become even more widespread if women on Medicaid lose their coverage.

Alex Crossan, otherwise known as Mura Masa isn't like most 21 year olds. In three short years he's established a profile as one of the top beat makers in indie spaces on the internet. He got there by leveraging influence from across the world.

Most important to his early success was the proliferation of a new breed of internet music blog. These are groups like Majestic Casual or Soulection — outlets that operate more like collectives than promotional hubs. The artists that get posted on these channels are informed by a global aesthetic that's only made possible by the internet.

Memphis Design movement dominated the '80s with their crazy patterns and vibrant colors. Many designers and architects from all around the world contributed to the movement in order to escape from the strict rules of modernism. Although their designs didn't end up in people's homes, they inspired many designers working in different mediums. After their first show in Milan in 1981, everything from fashion to music videos became influenced by their visual vocabulary.

Note: A previous version of this video referred imprecisely to ""Neolithic Britain"" when discussing the Newgrange tomb in Ireland. We have removed that phrasing. My apologies to the Irish.

Stonehenge is a popular destination for summer solstice celebrations because the 5,000-year-old monument points toward the summer solstice sunrise on the horizon. However, it also points to the winter solstice sunset in the opposite direction and there's good reason to believe that this may have been the more important alignment for the Neolithic people who built Stonehenge.

When the culture of hip hop first began to take shape in the 1970s, it consisted of at least four fundamental elements: DJing, emceeing, graffiti, and breaking. Breaking, popularly known as breakdancing today, was created in the Bronx in New York City by Black and Latino youths. The term breakdancing as it’s used in the media, often mixes the dances of New York’s b-boying and west coast developed dance styles like popping, locking, and the electric bugaloo. Breaking began as a mode of self-expression; it was a part of a larger culture that reflected the social, economic, and political conditions of the youth at that time. It reached peak popularity in the mid-1980s, when a number of films were released showcasing it’s moves and the youth who created it—films like Flashdance, Beat Street, Wild Style, and Krush Groove.

I spoke with my friend Sasha, who works in Barentsburg training Arctic sled dog teams. Dog breeds like the Husky or Samoyed were traditionally bred in Siberia, but in the 1920s when international dog standards were developing, the Soviet Union was closed to the world. Because of this, these traditionally Russian breeds fell under the administration of the Nordic Dog Union. Today, this has led to a schism about the identity and origins of these dogs.

Subscribe to our channel! http://goo.gl/0bsAjO

When you watch installments of the Warner Bros. line of Lego movies, it's hard not to be struck by how realistic the animation is. It isn't quite traditional stop motion — but it sure looks as if it could be. That's largely thanks to the work of the animators at Animal Logic, a Sydney-based visual effects studio that has worked on The Lego Movie, The Lego Batman Movie, and the upcoming The Lego Ninjago Movie. Powered by live action filming techniques and a close attention to detail, the studio has helped reinvent what Lego animations can look like. But they owe a lot of that aesthetic to the influence of fan films. Since the early 1970s, enthusiasts have made home movies with their own Lego sets. They're called Brickfilms — and they've grown into a sizable community producing great movies and helping many young animators get their start. The Lego Movie animators learned from what made those home movies so good by embracing the limitations of the medium, and creating a world that anyone could could rebuild at home. 

Check out some of the Brickfilms we showed in this video:

Tommy Wiseau’s film The Room (2003) is by many accounts the worst movie ever made. The plot barely makes sense, the set design is comically inept, and most of the dialogue sounds like it was fed through Google Translate multiple times. Yet, for 14 years, people have been congregating at midnight screenings all across the globe to watch what some people call “the Citizen Kane of bad movies.”

Despite the film’s incoherency, audiences ritualistically throw plastic spoons, shout call and response lines at the screen, and toss around footballs in the aisles at monthly screenings. Knowing all the inside jokes and participatory cues gives viewers what sociologist Pierre Bourdieu termed “cultural capital.” People who know when to shout specific lines or when to hurl spoons are deemed Room veterans.

Contrary to what you may think, researchers have found that an appreciation of this kind of “trash cinema” can actually indicate higher levels of intelligence. Trash films share more characteristics with avant-garde art films than they do with typical commercial Hollywood fare. Audiences are drawn to both “trash” and “art” films for many of the same reasons, like their transgressive nature and their rejection of mainstream aesthetic norms.

Watch the video to know more about The Room and be sure to pick up Bissell’s book (that he co-wrote with Greg Sestero) to read many more legendary stories about the production of the “best worst movie.”

Cable news pundits and columnists have compared President Donald Trump as a toddler, saying he's unable to control his speech or actions. But really, his behavior is better explained by his decades-long business career. Trump repeatedly broke the rules, exploited loopholes, and settled court cases without admitting wrongdoing or suffering serious financial harm. 

And Trump's experience isn't unique. America has a long history of treating corporate law breakers with far more leniency than other criminals.

I spent a day in Oslo before traveling to Svalbard, and noticed that there were Teslas everywhere. Upon further investigation, I learned that the Norwegian government heavily incentivizes ownership of electric cars: Tesla doesn't pay a sales tax on the models it sells, electric car owners are exempt from automobile tolls, and they can charge their vehicles for free. The catch is that Norway funds these initiatives through its sovereign wealth fund, which is almost entirely comprised of profits from Norway's oil and fossil fuel exports.

Follow Strikethrough on Facebook! https://www.facebook.com/CarlosMazaVox/

In the coverage of the Republican effort to repeal and replace Obamacare, cable news networks have largely fixated on the drama of trying to get the Republican’s bill through Congress: the vote whipping, the partisan infighting, and Trump’s efforts to make a “deal” with the more conservative members of his party.

Treating the debate over health care like an episode of House of Cards might make for good television, but it fails to accomplish the basic goal of good political journalism: to explain why this stuff matters to people outside of DC. And if the angry town halls across the country reveal anything, it’s that you don’t need the drama of congressional politics to make people care about what’s happening to their health care.

Voguing is fairly new, created in the 80s, compared to the New York City drag ballroom scene which goes back to at least the 1920s. The dance's name is borrowed from Vogue magazine. The movements that define voguging are also styled after the model poses in Vogue. Willi Ninja, considered the godfather of vogue, also drew inspirations from some unlikely sources such as mimes and martial arts. Voguing also happens at Kiki balls—like a junior legeauge before the main competitions of the ballroom scene. In the LGBTQ community voguing is more than just a popular dance fad co-opted into mainstream. Surrogate families called houses are also a major part of the ballroom scene.

///

In his book, The Success Equation, Michael Mauboussin places sports on the skill-luck continuum by using a statistical technique earlier demonstrated by sports data analysts. He found that season standings for the NBA reflect skill levels more so than the seasons of other major team sports, with NHL hockey being the sport closest to the luck side of the continuum. In this video we explore the characteristics of the sports that either enhance or diminish the influence of luck on the results, and we'll walk through the method for calculating the contribution of luck.

While in Japan I noticed vending machines everywhere. Looking into it a little deeper a discovered that there's a very interesting answer to why Japan has so many vending machines. It's an economic story but it's also a story about how Japanese society values robotics and automation.

Subscribe to our channel! http://goo.gl/0bsAjO

The late 19th century inaugurated a period of bicycle mania in the U.S. In 1897 alone over 2 million bicycles were sold, one for about every 30 Americans. Early bicycles were unwieldy and required an enormous amount of strength to operate. But as the technology advanced and chain-powered “safety” bicycles came onto the scene, women flocked to bikes en masse as a new means of exercise and transportation. This new activity required a change in dress since the billowing skirts that were fashionable at the time were unwieldy and problematic. “Bloomers”, or baggy undergarments, were easier to cycle in and became common among women, inciting a political firestorm, enraging men who questioned the decency of women who were challenging norms and donning clothing they viewed as depraved. Bicycles not only gave women a new sense of independence, it also physically broadened their horizons, allowing them expanded mobility without needing to rely on men. These developments contributed to the fight for women’s equality and the passing of the 19th amendment giving women the right to vote, with Susan B. Anthony even going so far as to say that bicycles had “done more to emancipate women than anything else in the world.”

The Paper Time Machine: https://unbound.com/books/paper-time-machine

Photo colorization isn’t just coloring within the lines — it requires meticulous research to make sure that every detail is historically accurate. The color of military uniforms, signs, vehicles, and world fashion spanning decades needs to be accounted for before even opening digital software like Photoshop. That means digging through sources like diaries, government records, old advertisements, and even consulting historical experts to get the colors right.

But even after the arduous research, restoration, and blending of color, the image still isn’t finished. In order to achieve true photorealism, the physics of how light works in the atmosphere needs to be taken into account. Colors look different depending on the lighting conditions when the photo was taken, so artists rely on shadows and the location of light to make an educated guess about the time of day in a black-and-white photo.

The Arctic is warming twice as fast as the rest of the globe. Every year the ocean ice in the Arctic melts and refreezes again the winter. But recently the ice has been melting faster than ever. This means that the ice sheets are becoming thinner. This matters because ocean ice performs important regulatory functions for our planet.

Subscribe to our channel! http://goo.gl/0bsAjO

“Go vegan!” and “It’s not food, it’s violence!” are two rallying cries that animal welfare activists have been chanting for years. But for activist and vegan Matt Ball, the purist ideologies espoused in those mantras might actually work against the goal of reducing and ultimately ending animal slaughter. 

Despite the animal advocacy from vegan and animal welfare groups, consumption of meat has grown in the United States from 183 pounds of red meat and poultry per capita in 1975 — the year Peter Singer’s seminal Animal Liberation was published — to an estimated 217.8 pounds this year.

Making matters worse, more than 80 percent of people who adopt a vegetarian (let alone vegan) diet ultimately go back to eating meat. According to Ball, vegetarians go back to their meat-eating ways in part because “they can't stand the pressure to maintain a pure diet.”

Although he is sympathetic to vegan and traditional animal welfare activism, Ball believes the time has come for activists to reconsider their tactics. That’s why in early 2014, he co-founded a new organization called One Step for Animals. Their goal is not to get individuals to take on any given lifestyle or diet, but rather to convince as many people as possible to simply stop eating chicken.

But while Japan's nationalism looks similar to other right-wing movements in the West, when you look under the surface, you see a totally different story.

Ramzan Kadyrov is the leader of Chechnya. He is a Putin proxy that has been in charge of the Russian republic since 2007. Recent reports have alleged that Kadyrov is systematically identifying and persecuting homosexual Chechen citizens. Many have fled the country in fear and have given interviews detailing his plans to kidnap, torture, and kill gay people. 

Despite the dark revelations, Kadyrov has continued to maintain an upbeat profile on Instagram, where he is a prolific user. Post by post, Kadyrov has used the social media platform to carefully craft a public image that distracts from his sinister behavior. Online he tends to post pictures of animals, selfies with friends, sports clips, and glamorous footage of Grozny, the capital of Chechnya. 

On the other hand, he also features imagery that hints at the darker aspects of his leadership. Kadyrov has a personal militia, called the “Kadyrovtsy”, and in various posts they can be seen shooting guns, performing training exercises, and practicing combat tactics. In doing so, he implies a clear threat to anyone who chooses to cross the Chechen leader. 

Two other common subjects are his religious faith and Vladimir Putin. Kadyrov is a devout Muslim and he leverages his faith to promote a strict interpretation of Islam: one that limits the role of women and endorses cruel punishment. He is also a fervent supporter of Vladimir Putin, the president of Russia. By featuring Putin in his posts, Kadyrov makes his deference to the Russian leader explicit. That is because Putin helped bring Kadyrov to power and affirms the authority of his Chechen subordinate. 

As long as Kadyrov maintains stability in the North Caucasus, Putin will continue to protect Kadyrov. That being said, if anyone is going to hold Kadyrov responsible for the troubling accusations about gay persecution, it will be Vladimir Putin. The more the world takes notice, the more Putin will have to, as well.

Tap dancing originated in America. It's a mix of several dance styles—Irish jigging, British clogging, and the percussive steps from African dance. Tap dancing can be traced back to Five Points, now known as Chinatown in New York city. Tap dance also has its roots in minstrel shows, where it was viewed as American comedy. In the 70s, tap dancing legends, Jane Goldberg and Brenda Bufalino took tap from the bright show tune lights of Broadway back to a place of self expression.

Australia's Great Barrier Reef is the largest coral reef system in the world and the only living structure visible from space. Although ecosystem managers in Australia have worked hard to preserve the reefs, the past couple of decades have brought a new threat that can't be solved by any one country alone: human-induced global warming. Rising ocean temperatures have caused mass coral bleaching in coral reefs around the world, in every tropical ocean from the Caribbean to the South Pacific. This is now considered to be the biggest threat that coral reefs face, and they face many, including overfishing, pollution, storm damage, and invasive species.

qLc5QJsMgvw,Vox,UCLXo7UDZvByw2ixzpQCufnA,The evolution of American protest music,2017-05-20 12:00:04+00:00,"Music is a critical form of expression in American politics — especially in times of political and social unrest.

Subscribe to our channel! http://goo.gl/0bsAjO

Dating back to the early days of colonization, American protest songs have shifted in style and form. The earliest protest songs were written in an era of oral tradition, where simplicity and familiarity were required to make music the music catch on.

The invention of sound recording subsequent mass distribution on the radio changed the way that society interacted with protest music. Now the songs didn't necessarily need to be so catchy, or based on melodies that people already knew. That thread led to an explosion of the art form, with artists from jazz, gospel, folk and many other backgrounds contributing to the protest music canon. 

In the 1980s, the advent of music video on television opened up a new medium of artistic expression. Now there was a visual element to add to a video — the filmed content as potent as the music itself in directing discourse. 

In the modern era, interactivity reigns supreme. Whether it's a clever deliverance of a hashtag, or multiplatform virality, protest music has adapted to the era by using modern tools to boost the point of views of artists. 

You can read more on the history behind these songs and many more in this write-up here by Vox.com staff writer Bridgett Henwood.

Follow Strikethrough on Facebook! https://www.facebook.com/CarlosMazaVox/

Fox News has spent the week doing damage control for the Trump White House. Between Trump’s intelligence leak to the Russian ambassador and an alarming memo from former FBI director James Comey, Fox has been working overtime to downplay and distract from Trump’s mistakes. And the more Fox convinces Republican voters to shrug off major Trump scandals, the less likely it becomes that Congressional Republicans will feel the need to keep the president’s actions in check.

In 1969, two Berkeley researchers, Paul Kay and Brent Berlin, published a book on a pretty groundbreaking idea: that every culture in history, when they developed their languages, invented words for colors in the exact same order. They claimed to know this based off of a simple color identification test, where 20 respondents identified 330 colored chips by name. If a language had six words, they were always black, white, red, green, yellow, and blue. If it had four terms, they were always black, white, red, and then either green or yellow. If it had only three, they were always black, white, and red , and so on. The theory was revolutionary — and it shaped our understanding of how color terminologies emerge.

Pomp & Circumstance has long been a graduation anthem. Part of Edward Elgar's infamous military marches, the tune was composed in the midst of the Boer War, a conflict that expanded the British empire in search of diamonds and gold. When the song was used for Edward VII's coronation, it was lent words that, even today, promote the British empire. That's why the version with lyrics is known as ""Land of Hope and Glory.""

The famous song was used when Elgar received an honorary degree at Yale and, quite simply, people liked how it sounded. It quickly spread and became a graduation anthem in America (and remained an unofficial national anthem in the UK). Today, we hear it everywhere — and it's all thanks to Edward Elgar's unique place in British culture.

-- They’re at the opposite ends of the spectrum in their beliefs: Ataturk was a militant secularist, Erdogan a committed Islamist
-- Erdogan’s rise shows arc of Turkish history, from democracy to an ever more theocratic authoritarian state
-- This all matters because a more religious version of Vladimir Putin is now at the helm of the biggest, richest and most militarily powerful US ally in the region.

Borders can seem almost arbitrary when you look at a map, but these lines have enormous impact on people’s lives. That story — the human story of what happens when we draw lines on a map — is the one I want to tell, but I need your help.

The rise of nationalist figures in Europe, Japan, India, and the US has been met with the call to fortify borders, and recapture a strong national identity. Phrases like “Build the wall!” and “Brexit” have become a part of everyday conversations.

Based on your suggestions, I will travel to six borders around the world this summer. While I travel, I will be publishing video dispatches on Facebook, Instagram and the Vox YouTube channel, culminating in six documentaries to publish in the fall.

I want you to travel with me and be a part of my reporting. The topic is broad, and these stories will be strongest if they emerge from the input of a lot of people. You can follow along on Facebook and Instagram to see where I’m going, make suggestions, and ask follow-up questions as I make these videos.

Subscribe to our channel! http://goo.gl/0bsAjO

President Trump courted controversy throughout his unorthodox presidential campaign not only for his outrageous statements, but also for his social media habits that critics dubbed as bullying. 

Today Trump’s personal account is the 41st most followed on Twitter. But even though he has amassed a large following, his off-the-cuff tweeting approach hasn’t changed. Since winning the presidential election, Trump has used twitter to insult Meryl Streep, opine on foreign policy and complain about the reporting of media outlets such as CNN and The New York Times. 

But there are some policy makers, such as Senator Cory Booker of New Jersey that use the platform differently. While serving as mayor of Newark, New Jersey, Booker made a name for himself on Twitter by personally responding to constituent requests made through the platform. He even delivered diapers to a Newark denizen stuck at home with her child during a snowstorm after he had heard about the situation on Twitter. 

Like many with a large following, Booker is often the subject of insults and trolls on social media.  But unlike the president, he often responds to his online critics with kindness.  

Watch the video, the latest from our Vox Voices series, to see how the former “Mayor of Twitter” and current Senator from New Jersey uses social media to take on critics (including friendly jabs from Mindy Kaling) and why he thinks President Trump should use Twitter to help unite a divided America.

Read Alex's original article here: http://www.vox.com/2017/4/3/14685348/gudetama-sanrio-hello-kitty-explained


When you think about the cuteness culture in Japan, the word “kawaii” comes to mind. The word, which signals more of a childlike sense of cute, came about in the 70s and it’s been used globally ever since. And Sanrio, the company that created Hello Kitty, has built an empire around the “kawaii” culture. Cuteness is a reaction. In Japan, the kawaii culture and concept is often linked to the country’s post-WWII years. The idea is that, because of its trauma and defeat, the country leaned into its vulnerability. Decades later— Sanrio’s new face of kawaii is an egg yolk with depression, questioning life.

What we’re learning, day by day, is there’s no magic to Trump. When he does things people hate, he becomes unpopular. When he backs bad legislation and bad processes, the bills fail. When he doesn’t prioritize staffing his government, his government doesn’t get staffed. When he doesn’t choose aides who know how to manage a presidency, his presidency careens forward unmanaged. When he doesn’t spend time learning about the policies he backs, he’s unable to persuade the American people of their benefits. When he doesn’t build deep relationships with the legislators in his party, he proves unable to corral them.

Trump has not found a shortcut for American politics. To succeed at a hard job, he has to work hard in ways and at tasks that he has, thus far, shown little aptitude for or interest in.

Trump himself may never be a normal president, but the system he leads remains more normal than many expected. While it's easy to imagine scenarios where that ceases to be true — a terrorist attack, for instance — the fact remains that so far, incompetence, not autocracy or even ruthless efficacy, has defined the Trump administration. He has achieved much less than his predecessors at this point in their presidencies, and he has done so at great cost to his own popularity. Trump is struggling with the same veto points and limitations that frustrate all presidents, but he is further held back by his own inexperience and undisciplined approach.

It is possible Trump will yet recover. But it is also possible he’ll enter a failure loop, where his unpopularity and his scandals and his failed initiatives and his poor management lead to more public anger and more aggressive congressional investigation and more failed initiatives and more fracturing and infighting among his staff. The 2018 elections are a long way away, but Trump is off to a very bad start.

Follow Strikethrough on Facebook! https://www.facebook.com/CarlosMazaVox/

Fox News’ decision to fire Bill O’Reilly over his history of sexual harassment allegations is a big deal. The problem is: O’Reilly’s replacements aren’t much of an improvement. Fox’s new primetime lineup is stacked with network personalities with their own histories of harassing women, including guests and even co-hosts. And it’s not just primetime -- on-air harassment has been a recurring element in Fox News’ programming for years, especially on shows like Fox & Friends. Given the new lineup of personalities who have their own patterns of mistreating women on-air, the network isn’t showing signs of an overhaul just yet.

Cities and counties that limit their cooperation with federal immigration agents are sometimes called ""sanctuaries,"" but the word doesn't actually have any legal meaning. However, because the constitution prohibits the federal government from making states enforce its laws, cities, counties, and other local jurisdictions have lots of freedom to ignore, or comply with, requests from federal agencies like ICE to detain undocumented immigrants for deportation.

Philadelphia's mural arts program started in the 1980s as an anti-graffiti initiative under Mayor Wilson Goode. But founder Jane Golden took the idea far from its anti-graffiti roots.

Today, Mural Arts Philadelphia is a large public art organization that innovates through public and private funds. These murals increase property values, draw in tourists, and help employ the artists creating them. In addition to that, the public art can be a tool for communities to express themselves.

Famous Philadelphia murals have included works by Shepard Fairey, Keith Haring, Meg Saligman, and many others. That makes it a unique model of public art for cities around the world.

Marine Le Pen is the leader of France's far-right political party, Front National or the ""National Front"". She took over the party in 2011 from her father and founder of the party, Jean-Marie Le Pen. Since then, she has kicked her father out of the party as part of a process known as ""dédiabolisation"". By removing her father, Marine Le Pen hoped to cut ties with the anti-Semitic reputation that he had cultivated for the party. Despite this effort, her recent comments on the Vel' d'Hiv roundup have hindered her attempts to distance the party from it's xenophobic and anti-Semitic past. As the French election approaches, many are wondering whether the nationalist fervor that has swept across Europe will continue gaining momentum in France. Like British leaders promising a Brexit, Le Pen would like to secure a referendum for a Frexit from The European Union, which she believes is a globalist organization that favors German interests over those of France. In addition to the threat of globalization, she fears the erosion of a distinctly French identity. Accordingly, she would like to pursue anti-Immigration policies as president that would severely cut back on the rising number of asylum requests granted to newly arrived refugees from Syria, North Africa, and elsewhere in The Middle East. Like American president Donald Trump, she cites concerns about safety in order to defend her anti-immigration platform. In addition to restricting immigration, she has promised to protect France from Islamist fundamentalism, which she believes is a religious entity that serves to promote terrorism. Critics claim that her policies are Islamophobic, but she defends her platform by maintaining that her most pressing interest is protecting France for the French. In doing so, she often references the distinctly French concept of secularism known as laïcité. Recent terrorist attacks in Paris in 2015 and attacks in Nice in 2016 have stoked xenophobic and racist sentiments in France. Marine Le Pen is hoping that those fears translate into votes in the 2017 French presidential election.

Activist Debbie Dooley has some choice words for individuals who believe that fossil fuels have no impact on the environment. “If you think fossil fuel is not damaging the environment,” she says, “pull your car in a garage, start up your engine, and inhale the exhaust fumes for a few minutes and see what happens.”

You could be forgiven for suspecting that Dooley might be a Democrat. According to a Gallup poll conducted last year, 85 percent of Democrats believe humans are contributing to increases in global temperature. But she’s not. Dooley is a conservative, gun-owning Trump supporter who also happens to be a co-founder of the Tea Party.
 
Dooley runs Conservatives for Energy Freedom, where she advocates for the expansion of renewable energy and for cuts to government regulations she believes hinder that growth. Through her efforts, she has even won over unlikely allies such as Al Gore.
 
The problem, according to Dooley, when speaking of her fellow conservatives, is that “they've been brainwashed for decades into believing we're not damaging the environment.” As a result, Dooley speaks with her fellow conservatives about renewable energy in a political language conservatives respect, using phrases like energy freedom, energy choice, and national security.

According to Dooley, when speaking to conservatives in these terms, “you have a receptive audience and they will listen to you. If you lead off with climate change, they're not going to pay a bit of attention to anything else you say.”

Update: This video was originally published on Vox platforms on February 27, 2017. Since that time, the Israeli police have arrested a 19-year-old Jewish man with dual American-Israeli citizenship as the main suspect in hundreds of bomb threats made against Jewish community centers in the US and worldwide. http://www.vox.com/2017/3/23/15038030/jewish-community-center-jcc-suspect-arrest-bomb-threat-israel-us

Bomb threats against Jewish community centers across the country. The desecration of headstones at a Jewish cemetery in St. Louis, Missouri.

For Christian Picciolini, these recent incidents are not necessarily surprising. He’s at the forefront of warning Americans against the growing threat from white nationalists.

What makes Picciolini’s insight into these individuals so compelling is that he used to be one.

When he was only 14, Picciolini was recruited by Clark Martell, a prominent neo-Nazi skinhead leader. By age 18, Picciolini was leading America’s first neo-Nazi skinhead gang and helping to recruit and organize cells across the country.

Picciolini worked to soften the neo-Nazis’ external image and political language to attract individuals who would otherwise not have been willing to join the movement.

“We hear terms like ‘liberal media,’ when in fact what they are talking about is Jewish media,” Picciolini told me. “We used to say that the Jews controlled the media. And now they've just massaged the phrase to call it ‘liberal media.’”

Picciolini began his transformation from neo-Nazi to anti-hate advocate in his late teens.

“Having my child when I was 19 years old and being married was a powerful catalyst for me because I finally had something to love,” he said.

In 2010 he co-founded Life After Hate, a not-for-profit organization dedicating to fighting racism and violent extremism. Five years later he published his memoirs of his time in the neo-Nazi movement, Romantic Violence: Memoirs of an American Skinhead.

“I'm still pulling up the weeds from all those seeds of hate that I planted,” he said, “which is why I have dedicated the last 20 years of my life to help eradicate racism.”

This video features a clip courtesy of Human Planet, a BBC, Discovery Channel and France Television Co-Production. 
Check out BBC Earth Unplugged's video of ""Falcon vs Car"": https://youtu.be/iq5DxzTTVgo

Peregrine falcons are the fastest animals of the land—and it's no wonder, their bodies are built for speed. While cheetahs can run up to 70 mph on land, peregrine falcons can dive at speed of over 200 mph. That's faster than a 100 mph sneeze and around the same speed as a Formula One racing car. Peregrines are light in weight, aerodynamically shaped, and have robust respiritary systems; all of which allows them to be the fastest birds of prey, and animals in general. Peregrine falcon numbers took a massive hit during much of the 20th century in North America. They became nearly extinct because of pesticides, specifically DDT. The chemical made the falcon's—and many other birds — eggshells thinner, preventing the embryos from developing, in addition to poisoning adult falcons. In 1972, DDT was banned and recovery efforts for peregrine falcons began soon after. By 1999, with concerted effort peregrine falcons saw their numbers increase dramatically and were removed the Endangered Species list.

Subscribe to our channel! http://goo.gl/0bsAjO

When Syrian-American author and civil rights lawyer Alia Malek woke up to the images of Syrians dying from a chemical weapons attack in the town of Khan Sheikhoun last week, her immediate response was pain, anger, and frustration.   

“But at the same time,” Malek told me, “there have been so many mornings like that in the last six years.”
 
Since the start of the Syrian civil war in 2011 more than 5 million Syrians have become refugees. Moreover, at least 470,000 Syrians have died, the vast majority by methods other than chemical weapons. Yet it was the chemical attack on Khan Sheikhoun and the Trump administration’s retaliatory decision to launch 59 cruise missiles against a Syrian air base that resulted in heaps of media coverage.    

This all led Malek, who has chronicled the story of her family and her time in Syria in her new book, The Home that was Our Country: A Memoir of Syria, to question why “we object to the methods of slaughter, but not the overall slaughter that the Syrian people.“

The kidney transplant wait list has been increasing sharply in the US over the past two decades. Most transplants come from deceased donors — people who elect to donate their organs when they die. But there's another large source of potential kidneys: living donors. Since we have two kidneys, most people can share a kidney with other people. Most living donors give a kidney to someone they know, like a relative or a friend. But there are also non-directed living kidney donors, other wise known as altruistic donors or good samaritans. Watch this video to see the story of one such donor, Dylan Matthews.

The Supreme Court has long recognized the potential for abuse in the redistricting system. But the Justices have had trouble establishing an objective measure to rule on the fairness of a political map.

Professor Wendy Tam Cho of the University of Illinois set out to fix this problem. Her goal? To create a “Computational Method for Identifying Extreme Redistricting Plans,” as she put it in the subtitle of one research paper. The video above gives an overview of the process Cho proposed.

If you would like to know more about your state’s redistricting law, I recommend checking out this website from Justin Levitt, a professor of constitutional law at Loyola University Law School.

After four-plus years of fighting, Syria's war has killed at least hundreds of thousands of people and displaced millions. And, though it started as a civil war, it's become much more than that. It's a proxy war that has divided much of the Middle East, and has drawn in both Russia and the United States. To understand how Syria got to this place, it helps to start at the beginning and watch it unfold:

Note: An earlier version of this video incorrectly stated that Boi-1da produced One Dance. It also incorrectly set the dates on Views and If You're Reading This It's Too Late. 
---------------
The cultural history we’re discussing in this video extends beyond Drake in so many ways that couldn’t fit into this video. So here are some links to further watching / reading to get a better picture of the Caribbean-Canadian connection.

The first is this video by TheNerdwriter1. It focuses on the difference between tropical house and dancehall, with a nice little explainer on the history behind dancehall’s significance in Jamaican culture. https://youtu.be/ljbohB2_WnU

The second resource is in the Statistics Canada website. It’s where I got the map you saw in the video. And it can give you a closer look at the figures I talk about in the video.
www.statcan.gc.ca/pub/89-621-x/89-621-x2007012-eng.htm 

Finally, I recommend the culture writing in the FADER, particularly when it focuses on greater Toronto. Here are some of my favorite pieces:

The first few months of the Trump administration have been a goldmine for late-night comedians and political satirists. Shows like Full Frontal With Samantha Bee, Saturday Night Live, and Late Night With Seth Meyers have enjoyed ratings boosts thanks to their regular lampooning of the Trump White House.

But beyond the jokes and sight gags, political satirists have done an excellent job of seriously covering the Trump administration — sometimes even better than major TV news networks. And that’s because while traditional journalists feel compelled to take President Trump’s often absurd statements and conspiracy theories seriously, political satirists have demonstrated an extremely low tolerance for bullshit.

Read Alvin's article here: http://www.vox.com/2016/7/11/12109786/dog-death-research

When Alvin lost his dog Rainbow, he felt as though a human has died. 

Humans have a special — and somewhat an odd — relationship with dogs. 60% of Americans own a pet, and the most popular of them are dogs. Our relationship with them actually goes back pretty far. Some scholars believe that wolves and humans hunted and lived among each other — and the reason humans came out on top was because we partnered with wolves. Then, as we evolved so did our furry friends. Now, we treat these animals like family. We give them names, keep them safe, and share our lives with them. So when it's time for them to go, it feels a lot like we're losing a part of the family.

Medieval snails and knights — who knew? It turns out that medieval illuminated manuscripts featured a lot of bizarre imagery in the margins, but this pocket of art history might be one of the most intriguing.

Scholar Lilian Randall provides the best theory for the unusual motif: these medieval knights fought snails in the margins because snails represented the Lombards, who had become widely despised lenders throughout Europe. Snail was an insult and, over time, it became a type of meme detached from its original meaning.

Of course, like much of art history, this theory is just a theory. But it gives us an insight into the rich culture of marginal art and all the complexity, confusion, and amusement that sits on the side of the page.

Most often, the US Supreme Court grants or denies petitions to hear a case after reviewing a written request called a ""petition for writ of certiorari"". Also called ""the writ of cert"", it is reviewed by the Justices and granting the petition depends on whether or not it passes ""the rule of four"". If it does, the case is probably one of three types: a case of national importance, a case in which a lower court decision has invalidated federal law, or a case involving a split decision in lower courts. Famously, Bush v. Gore was an example of national importance, Gonzales v. Raich was a case in which a lower court invalidated federal law,  and Obergefell v. Hodges was selected by the Court in order to resolve a circuit split decision. By following this protocol of case selection, the Court has been designed to be reactive to legislative decisions made in other branches of government, as opposed to an active legislative body that seeks to create and institute new laws. Overall, the result of this design is a Court that prioritizes case selections that will enable them to enforce the uniformity of federal law throughout the country.

The idea of defunding public media in the United States, as President Trump’s new budget proposes, is nothing new according to Shane Iverson, “but it’s serious every time it happens.”

Iverson is the general manager of a small public broadcast station in Bethel, Alaska — one of the only reliable news sources in the Bethel Census Area. And if the Trump budget were to pass, it would cut funding to the Corporation for Public Broadcasting — which would in turn mean that his station might not get the money it needs to stay open.  

Iverson’s station, KYUK, is one of the hundreds of public media outlets to receive support from the Corporation for Public Broadcasting. In 2015, the CPB spent $129 million — or nearly 30 percent of its entire budget — on direct grants to support over 500 public broadcasters across the United States. 

Among those broadcasters were some 162 radio stations that serve rural communities with the mandate “to provide all Americans with free, over-the-air access to public broadcasting's programming and services.”

In the 49 years since its founding, the Corporation for Public Broadcasting has been successful in meeting that mandate. Today, 95 percent of all Americans can freely watch or listen to public media, including programming from NPR and PBS. 
But if President Trump has it his way that might change. If his new federal budget proposal were to pass as is, the entire budget of the CPB would be cut. 

National broadcasters NPR and PBS could most likely survive the elimination of the CPB. But small market public broadcasters, most often found in rural American towns, often rely heavily on federal funding. And they might find themselves unable to continue operations. Disappearing with them would be the local news and programming that many rural communities depend on. 

It’s that scenario that Shane Iverson, the general manager of a small public broadcast station in Bethel, Alaska, hopes does not come to pass.

Vladimir Putin has been ruling Russia since 1999. In that time he has shaped the country into an authoritarian and militaristic society. The Soviet Union dissolved into 15 new countries, including the new Russian Federation. In Putin’s eyes, Russia had just lost 2 million square miles of territory. But Putin’s regime has also developed and fostered the most effect cyber hacker army in the world and he’s used it to wreak havoc in the West. But the election of Donald Trump brings new hope for the Putin vision. Trump’s rhetoric has been notably soft on Russia. He could lift sanctions and weaken NATO, potentially freeing up space for Putin’s Russia to become a dominant power once again.

China has given pandas to foreign powers long before the 20th century, but the most current iteration of panda diplomacy began in the 1950s with its gifting of Ping Ping and An An to the Soviet Union. Today, pandas are no longer gifted, but rather loaned to other countries, particularly those with which China wants to develop and strengthen relations. Not only are pandas an iconic symbol of China and its culture, they also act as diplomats in China’s global political strategy.

The 2017 Oscars ended with a pretty shocking mix-up. Announcer Warren Beatty incorrectly named La La Land as the Best Picture winner, and the mistake wasn't revealed until crew members had already started giving their acceptance speeches. A lot of things went wrong for the snafu to happen the way it did. But what if typography was one of them? A better announcement card design could have made for a very different Academy Awards show — not to mention a much less embarrassing Miss Universe show for Steve Harvey back in 2015. But the implications of bad typography don't end there: poorly designed ballots in the 2000 presidential election arguably could have swayed the outcome, and illegible type on medicine bottles could be causing nearly 500,000 cases of drug misuse per year in the U.S.

For most Americans, terrorism is only ever experienced through a television screen or front page of a newspaper. Many Americans rely on cable news in the wake of high-profile tragedies, and news networks see ratings spikes in the wake of terrorist attacks. Those ratings incentivize news networks to sensationalize their coverage, repeatedly airing graphic images of violence and combing over the excruciating details of attacks. That kind of news coverage causes Americans to overestimate the danger posed by terrorism, and our heightened fear can have serious consequences, causing us to overreact, pursue unhelpful security measures, and rally behind politicians who embrace over-the-top responses to terrorism.

You may think people grow beards because of their fashionability or warmth, but author and professor Stephen Mihm says there might be another reason. In a New York Times piece he makes the case that in Western countries, trends in beard popularity can be explained by economics by looking at trends in capitalism.

Throughout the 20th century many anti-capitalist movements adopted large, bushy, Karl Marx-like beards as signs of protest. Whenever these movements gained steam you saw a marked decrease in beard acceptance amongst wealthy and powerful American business leaders. But once these movements died down, CEOs and business tycoons often re-adopted beards to show their strength and rugged individuality.

Today we’re seeing a resurgence of beards acceptance, brought on by the young and wealthy leaders of Silicon Valley such as Elon Musk, Jack Dempsey, and originally Steve Jobs. 

But researchers argue we might be reaching something called “peak beard,” which occurs when beards become too popular and clean shaven men begin to become more attractive by comparison.","['vox.com', 'vox', 'explain', 'beard', 'beards', 'economics', 'facial hair', 'mustaches', 'mustache', 'shaving', 'shaved', 'capitalism', 'anarchy', 'anarchists', 'steven mihm', 'cat beard', 'cat beards', 'dean peterson', 'animation', 'animated', 'explainer', 'stache', 'stubble', 'socialism', 'socialist', 'communism', 'communist', 'economy', 'elon musk', 'steve jobs', 'silicon valley', 'tech boom', 'andrew carnegie', 'robber baron', 'peak beard', 'clean shaven', 'thick', 'growing a beard', 'scruff', 'karl marx']",none,240.0,hd,true,708289.0,11122.0,930.0,Friday,40

Elephants and their ancestors have roamed the African continent for millions of years. They are the largest land animals on earth and can live up to 70 years. Elephants are profoundly intelligent and social creatures. They have trunks that serves as their nose, arm, and fingers. But elephant populations have taken a massive hit to their populations. Despite an international ban on the ivory trade and other laws to protect elephants, their overall populations continue to fall due to habitat loss and rampant poaching for their tusks. Because of that, a once rare trait is being passed onto more African elephants. The trait is tusklessness, The loss of tusks is only the beginning. The real devastation occurs with the loss of a groups matriarch. The oldest and most experienced grandmothers are the family’s living memory of migration routes, friendly elephants, food and water sources, etc. Matriarchs are also, the first in line to protect their families and without them an entire group of elephants can fall apart. But with China banning ivory in 2017,  providing stronger incentives to protect elephants, and sustained conservation efforts from organizations like ElephantVoices, African Parks, and others, elephants may stand a chance to roam the continent as their ancestors once did.

Dictionaries don't just appear. People have to write them. At Merriam-Webster, one of those people is Kory Stamper.

The history of dictionaries involves a lot more than just looking at words. Lexicographers have to pore through hundreds of years of documents to understand where English has been and is going. Defining English, both for vocabulary and grammar, is a daunting task that Stamper tackles every day.

It opens into a wider grammatical debate as well, between prescriptivism and descriptivism, which pits two philosophies against each other.

By breeding house cats with wild animals, humans developed hybrid cats that look like little leopards. Bengal cats are a breed that was developed by breeding domestic cats with asian leopard cats. The first American bengal breeder is a woman named Jean Mill, but her work has continued through other breeders. We met one of those breeders, Anthony Hutcherson, when we went to film the cats at the Westminster Dog Show. Besides bengals, we also saw another hybrid breed: savannahs. Instead of asian leopard cats, savannahs were developed by breeding house cats with servals. Unlike the other two breeds, the last breed we met, toygers, are not hybrid cats. Breeder Judy Sugden created the breed by carefully breeding domestic cats with qualities that resemble wild tigers. To learn more about the cats and the breeders that made possible, watch the video above.

Subscribe to our channel! http://goo.gl/0bsAjO

[2:31] CORRECTION: A previous version of this video misstated the year of Andrew Johnson's impeachment. He was impeached in 1868, not 1863.

The founding fathers included impeachment in the constitution so that Congress would have a way to remove leaders who had ""rendered themselves obnoxious,"" in the words of Benjamin Franklin. But the way they set up the process, it's nearly impossible to remove a president from office without substantial support from the president's own party. That's what happened during Watergate: some congressional republicans protected Richard Nixon, but others demanded to know the extent of his involvement in a break-in at the headquarters of the Democratic National Committee, and the subsequent cover-up. In the words of then-Senator Howard Baker, a Republican from Tennessee, ""What did the President know, and when did he know it?"" It was pressure from Republican leaders like Barry Goldwater that made Nixon resign before the House could vote on articles of impeachment-- Goldwater convinced Nixon that too many Republicans were willing to vote to remove him from office, he'd never survive a Senate vote. 

The opposite was true during the impeachment proceedings for Bill Clinton. After it became clear he lied during a deposition for a sexual assault suit brought by a former employee, Paula Jones, about his relationship with a different employee, Monica Lewinsky, Republicans in Congress argued the offense was serious enough to be impeachable. Democrats disagreed, and although the House voted to impeach Clinton on a party-line vote, not a single Democratic senator voted to remove him from office. If a President still has the support of a majority of his political party, history suggests the chances for impeaching and removing him from office are slim to none.

While legal scholars, activists, and some Democratic members of Congress have pushed for articles of impeachment against Donald Trump, it seems unlikely at this point that a substantial number of Republicans would break rank in the Senate to create a 2/3 majority in favor of removal from office.

Republicans in the House have finally released a bill to repeal and replace Obamacare: the American Health Care Act. The GOP healthcare bill keeps some of the most popular parts of Obamacare, like letting young adults stay on their parents' health insurance until age 26 and requiring insurance companies to cover people with pre-existing conditions. 

But the Republican bill gets rid of the key element that made Obamacare work: the individual mandate. Now that people aren't required to have insurance, healthy people could leave insurance pools en masse, leaving sick people who are more expensive to cover.

Hypocrisy is a minor sin in politics, but still, it is remarkable how much of it there is to be found in this legislation. A core Republican complaint when Obamacare was passed was that the law delayed many of its provisions in order to reduce public outcry and manipulate the CBO’s score. The GOP bill is similarly aggressive with such tricks, delaying changes to the Medicaid expansion until 2020 and pushing Obamacare’s tax on expensive insurance plans out until 2025.

Because Republicans aren’t even trying to win Democratic votes, they’re stuck designing a bill that can wiggle through the budget reconciliation process (another thing they complained about Democrats doing). That means they can’t make major changes to insurance markets like repealing Obamacare’s essential benefit standards or allowing insurance to be sold across state lines. That last part is particularly striking, given that it was one of President Trump’s five demands in his speech last week. I’ve always been skeptical about the savings Republicans could wrest by changing those regulations, but now they can’t get those savings at all — which means sacrificing a key part of their theory of cost control.

This bill has a lot of problems, and more will come clear as experts study its language, the Congressional Budget Office release its estimates, and industry players make themselves heard. But the biggest problem this bill has is that it’s not clear why it exists. What does it make better? What is it even trying to achieve? Democrats wanted to cover more people and reduce long-term costs, and they had an argument for how their bill did both. As far as I can tell, Republicans have neither. At best, you can say this bill makes every obvious health care metric a bit worse, but at least it cuts taxes on rich people? Is that really a winning argument in American politics?

In reality, what I think we’re seeing here is Republicans trying desperately to come up with something that would allow them to repeal and replace Obamacare. This is a compromise of a compromise of a compromise aimed at fulfilling that promise. But “repeal and replace” is a political slogan, not a policy goal. This is a lot of political pain to endure for a bill that won’t improve many peoples’ lives, but will badly hurt millions.

The Doomsday Clock began as a graphic on the first edition of the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists’ magazine. Since then, the Bulletin has used the clock as a symbol for their interpretation of humanity’s approach toward the end of times, changing the time as new threats arise or old threats resolve. Originally, the Bulletin only changed the time when they felt the threat of nuclear weapons became more or less imminent, but the clock today reflects other types of threats as well, from climate change to cybersecurity to reckless language to Donald Trump.

Follow Strikethrough on Facebook! https://www.facebook.com/CarlosMazaVox/

After eight years of attacking President Obama, Fox has happily adapted to its new role as a guard dog for the Trump administration. But the relationship between Fox and Trump is less of a romance and more of a hostage situation. Rupert Murdoch, Executive Chairman of News Corp (which owns Fox News), was a vocal critic of Trump during the 2016 campaign. He criticized Trump’s position on immigration, accused Trump of “embarrassing” the country, and was once described as “the billionaire Donald Trump can’t win over.”
So what explains Murdoch’s change of heart? Why is one of Trump’s most influential critics allowing his network to turn into a Trump PR channel?

Read Sarah Kliff's full article: http://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2017/2/15/14563182/obamacare-lifetime-limits-ban

Timmy Morrison was delivered by emergency C-section, weighing in at 3 pounds, 9 ounces. Doctors put him under anesthesia within a week and into surgery within a month. Some of the contents of his stomach sometimes made their way to his lungs. Workers in the intensive care unit frequently needed to resuscitate him. He arrived seven weeks premature — but, in a way, just at the right time.

Six months before Timmy was born, President Barack Obama signed a sweeping health care law that would come to bear his name. Six days before Timmy’s birth, the Obama administration began to phase in a provision that banned insurance companies from limiting how much they would pay for any individual’s medical bills over his or her lifetime. At the time the Affordable Care Act passed, 91 million Americans had employer-sponsored plans that imposed those so-called lifetime limits.

That group included Timmy’s parents, whose plan previously included a $1 million lifetime limit. This Obamacare provision took effect September 23, 2010. Timmy was born September 29. On December 17, he surpassed $1 million worth of bills in the neonatal intensive care unit. He didn’t leave the NICU until he was 6 months old.

If Timmy had been born a week earlier, his medical benefits could have run out while he was still in the NICU. But that didn’t happen. His insurer covered everything. The NICU bills his parents save total just over $2 million (they come out to $2,070,146.94, to be exact).

Subscribe to our channel! http://goo.gl/0bsAjO

During the Great Migration, around 40% of America's Black population left Southern states to go north or west between 1915 and 1970, and the effects of that exodus continue to reverberate.

While the biggest changes took place decades ago, data shows that America’s Black population has continued to move again. These days, however, census findings from the past 40 years indicate a new pattern of Black migration back to the South and away from cities. America simply looks different than it did a century ago, and this new phase of migration is characterized by very different motivations than the last.

With the help of historian Isabel Wilkerson and demographer William Frey, this video maps the progression of Black Americans from the Reconstruction era until today.

The Futura font (really typeface, but let's drop the pedantry for the sake of clarity) is famous. Futura was created by Paul Renner in 1920s Germany, just as the Bauhaus movement was picking up steam. Though Renner wasn't Bauhaus, Futura had that flavor, which was part of the problem.

The newly powerful Nazis favored the ornate Fraktur type style to modern Futura, so they excluded both the type and its creator. Of course, Nazis are not just evil, but also often insane and inefficient — so Futura returned to Germany, as did Renner. But by that time, Futura had established itself as the international typeface of the future, and the font's legacy was secured.

That's even more clear when you learn about the lunar plaque that went up on Apollo 11. Futura was the font selected for that great task — making Futura the font that escaped the Nazis and landed on the moon.","['vox.com', 'vox', 'explain', 'futura', 'futura font', 'typeface', 'font', 'fonts', 'futura typeface', 'type', 'font history', 'history', 'almanac', 'design', 'design history', 'nazis', 'world war ii', 'apollo 11', 'lunar plaque', 'moon landing', 'moon', 'wes anderson', 'supreme', 'bauhaus', 'nazi', 'hitler', 'aesthetics', 'art', 'paul renner', 'renner', 'font design', 'font tutorial', 'font style', 'stanley kubrick', 'kubrick', 'royal tanenbaums', 'life aquatic', 'rushmore', 'twee', 'hipster', 'Vox Almanac', 'Phil Edwards']",none,267.0,hd,true,1260627.0,32269.0,719.0,Friday,42

Hollywood hasn’t always done a great job of representing the science community onscreen. On one hand, there’s cinema bogus like The Core’s premise that nuking the center of the Earth could reboot our magnetic field (it couldn’t), or the idea on NCIS that two heroes would fight hackers faster by both typing on the keyboard at the same time (they wouldn’t). On the other, there are broader problems with negative representations of science — scientists have been disproportionately written as film villains, and those media depictions have shaped historically negative perceptions of science as a career path. When children are asked to draw images of scientists, they predominantly depict old white men, and typically cite media depictions as their main source of inspiration. But since 2008, access to a scientist script adviser has been one toll-free phone call away for Hollywood professionals.

luTPMHC7zHY,Vox,UCLXo7UDZvByw2ixzpQCufnA,Why China is building islands in the South China Sea,2017-02-17 13:16:38+00:00,"China claims they aren't military bases, but their actions say otherwise. 

Join the Vox Video Lab: http://bit.ly/video-lab

Since 2014, China has been building islands in the middle of the South China Sea. What were once underwater reefs are now sandy islands complete with airfields, roads, buildings, and missile systems. In less than two years, China has turned seven reefs into seven military bases in the South China Sea, one of the most contentious bodies of water in the world.

The sea is one of the most important areas of ocean in the world. It’s estimated to hold 11 billion barrels of oil, 109 trillion cubic feet of natural gas, and 10 percent of the world’s fisheries. Most importantly, 30 percent of the world’s shipping trade flows through the South China Sea to the busy ports of Southeast Asia. It’s an incredibly important strategic area, and five countries currently claim some part of it.

Most countries base their claims off the United Nations Law of the Seas, which says a country’s territory extends 200 miles off its shores, an area called the exclusive economic zone, or EEZ. Any trade or resources that fall in a country’s EEZ belong to that country; they’re its sovereign territory. Any area that is not in an EEZ is considered international waters and subject to UN maritime law, meaning it’s shared by everyone. Every country in the region, which includes Malaysia, the Philippines, Brunei, and Vietnam, bases its claim to the South China Sea on the UN’s EEZ laws — except China.

China argues it has a historical claim to the South China Sea, dating back to naval expeditions in the 15th century. After World War II, the Japanese Empire lost control of the South China Sea, and China took advantage of the moment to reclaim it. On maps, it started drawing a dashed line that encompassed most of the South China Sea. This line became its official claim and is known today as the Nine-Dash Line, because it always has nine dashes. In 1973, when the UN law established EEZs, China reaffirmed its Nine-Dash Line, refusing to clarify the line’s boundaries and rejecting other countries’ claims.

Since then, tensions have built around who rightfully owns the South China Sea. The dispute has centered on the Spratly Islands, an archipelago at the heart of the South China Sea. Currently, China, Malaysia, the Philippines, and Vietnam claim some part of the Spratly Island chain. They’ve asserted their claims by putting small buildings, ports, and even some people on what are essentially rocks in the middle of the ocean.

But the Spratlys are very important, because whichever country can successfully claim them can extend its EEZ to include them, thus gaining miles of precious sovereign territory. This is why China began building up islands in 2014. By turning these rocks into military bases, the Chinese are now able to support hundreds of ships, bolstering their presence in the region. They are using fishing boats, surveillance ships, and navy destroyers to set up blockades around other countries’ islands and defend their own. This is all done very cautiously and in small steps in order to avoid sparking a wider conflict.

Since China began building islands, the disputes have not become violent. But tensions are building in the region. As China deploys more of its military to the Spratlys, other countries are getting nervous and building up their own islands. It’s a complex situation that will continue to gain international attention, for better or for worse.

Every time a big company is hacked, like when Yahoo got hacked in 2016 and exposed the personal info of over 1 billion accounts, experts tell us to stop trying to memorize all of our password and to use a password manager instead. A password manager is basically a virtual safe where you can safely store all of your passwords. Since when you use a password manager you don't have to remember every single password anymore, you can make them really long and complicated. Your passwords are also encrypted so even if your password manager gets hacked, all of the individual passwords stored within are safe from hackers.

j7F7Pil9tVQ,Vox,UCLXo7UDZvByw2ixzpQCufnA,Do I have ADHD?,2017-02-09 13:27:56+00:00,"Google can’t tell if you have ADHD or not.

Subscribe to our channel! http://goo.gl/0bsAjO

If you search “Do I have...” on Google, the first suggested phrase you’ll see is “Do I have ADHD?” And it’s easy to see why. The quizzes and self-diagnosing tests (I’ve gone through a few of them) are extremely relatable — especially when you do them while putting off chores. But here’s the thing: ADHD can easily be misdiagnosed.

There are two sides to this argument. Are there too many people being diagnosed with ADHD? Or too few? First, we spoke to Dr. Allen Frances, who believes ADHD is being overdiagnosed. He pointed to the number of studies done in the US, Taiwan, Iceland, and Canada showing that the youngest kid in a classroom was consistently more likely to be diagnosed with ADHD than the oldest kid. He says this problem is also due to time constraints faced by doctors.

On the other hand, Dr. David Goodman argues that ADHD is being underdiagnosed — especially for women. ADHD is harder to diagnose in women because while hyperactivity is common in men and boys, inattentiveness is more common for women and girls. He also argues that there is a pattern in psychiatry where mental disorders are dismissed before being taken seriously.

One thing’s for sure: A professional evaluation will always be better than Googling for self-diagnosing tests for ADHD, because misdiagnosis happens often and can be dangerous. For more information, check out the video above.

Subscribe to our channel! http://goo.gl/0bsAjO

In 1970, only one NFL player weighed over 300 pounds. That number grew each decade — from three in 1980, to 94 in 1990, to 301 in 2000, and finally to 532 in training camps in 2010.

So what changed?

Before 1950, the NFL limited substitutions. That meant that players often had to play multiple positions, and weren’t able to specialize. On top of that, restrictions on blocking below the waist during the 1970s allowed for linemen to become more top-heavy without having to worry about blocking moves that could knock out their knees. Paired with more advanced nutritional and training practices, the past three decades have enabled unprecedented growth in linemen’s body size.

But the rapid physical changes comes with serious health consequences. A 1994 government study found that NFL linemen die of heart disease at rates 52% higher than that of the general population, and three times the rates of NFL non-linemen. Further research in 2008 found that linemen suffer disproportionately from metabolic syndrome, which includes risk factors like obesity and high blood pressure.

Correction: We mistakenly highlighted Indiana University–Purdue University Indianapolis at 4:20 in the video as a for-profit university. Colorado Technical University, one above IUPUI in the list, is the for-profit institution we meant to highlight.

The best (and also free!) place to explore repayment options for federal student loans is: https://studentaid.ed.gov/sa/repay-loans

There's also the Public Service Loan Forgiveness Program. If you're employed by a government or certain type of nonprofit the program forgives the remaining balance on Direct Loans after 120 qualifying monthly payments while working full-time. https://studentaid.ed.gov/sa/repay-loans/forgiveness-cancellation/public-service#qualifying-employment

Higher education is expensive, so people want to get the best deal— a high quality college education at a low cost. This is similar in the way which many for-profit colleges and universities advertised themselves. Many students soon found that the cost of upward mobility through certain for-profit institutions wasn't the answer for them. 

These schools saw a huge jump in enrollment during the 2000s. Fueled by a struggling economy and the expansion of federal financial aid for college, many students saw the advertisements of for-profit schools as attainable and affordable. But almost two decade later, there are new regulations to reign in the predatory schools profiting off student debt. And today, over a dozen for-profit colleges in the US (ITT Tech, Corinthian Colleges, Sanford Brown, and others) have closed their doors for good.

Now they’re sounding the alarm, warning that South Sudan, the world’s newest country, is “on the brink of catastrophe” that could rival the horrors of the 1994 Rwandan genocide. In that conflict, some 800,000 people were slaughtered in the span of just 100 days while the international community watched, unable or unwilling to stop the bloodshed. Former President Bill Clinton has called his decision not to intervene one of the biggest regrets of his presidency.

mh9B5UJbbRg,Vox,UCLXo7UDZvByw2ixzpQCufnA,How I memorized an entire chapter from “Moby Dick”,2016-12-28 15:43:51+00:00,"With memory palaces, anyone can look like a memory genius.

I always thought I was born with a bad memory. I could never remember multiplication tables, I’m so bad with names, and I honestly couldn’t tell you what I ate for lunch two days ago. Yet I found a way to memorize an entire chapter of Moby Dick in less than four days. It turns out I was going about memorizing things all wrong.

The way most people are taught to memorize is by making flash cards and just repeating the information over and over again until it sticks. This is terribly ineffective, really frustrating, and the reason nobody can tell you what 8 times 12 is.

A much better technique is the “memory palace,” an idea that Joshua Foer explores in his book Moonwalking With Einstein. A memory palace is a mnemonic technique that allows you to more easily memorize information by creating corresponding visual images that you mentally place along a path in a familiar location.

xm4LO22-cyY,Vox,UCLXo7UDZvByw2ixzpQCufnA,The chord that makes Christmas music sound so Christmassy,2016-12-21 16:01:41+00:00,"Hint: Mariah Carey's ""All I Want for Christmas is You"" uses it. 

If you walk around a shopping mall, turn on the radio, or go to a coffee shop between Thanksgiving and Christmas, you’re going to hear Mariah Carey’s “All I Want for Christmas Is You.” It’s one of the only Christmas songs written in the last 20 or so years that has reached the same popularity as the American Christmas standards that came before it.

Besides those recognizable sleigh bells, what makes Mariah Carey’s song sound like a classic? Adam Ragusea, a journalism professor at Mercer University, believes it’s all in the chords. He wrote for Slate:

I count at least 13 distinct chords at work in “All I Want for Christmas Is You,” resulting in a sumptuously chromatic melody. The song also includes what I consider the most Christmassy chord of all—a minor subdominant, or “iv,” chord with an added 6, under the words “underneath the Christmas tree,” among other places. (You might also analyze it as a half-diminished “ii” 7th chord, but either interpretation seems accurate.)

In December, after an extended siege and a month of intense fighting, Bashar al-Assad’s forces seized control of the rebel-held eastern half of Aleppo. A withdrawal agreement allowed thousands of rebels and civilians to evacuate — but not before Assad’s forces massacred and tortured an unknown number of people. The Assad victory was a humanitarian disaster and a devastating blow to the embattled anti-government rebels — and something that was in the works for over a year. The above video explains why.

In The United States, checked baggage fees were introduced in 2008. Since then, ancillary fees for airline travel have become a significant source of revenue for US airlines. The amount of baggage fees paid by passengers in The United States was nearly $4 billion dollars last year. Despite the negative consequences of baggage fees, a new study has revealed one positive outcome for consumers. By comparing data from before and after the introduction of baggage fees, a group of business school researchers determined that the fees improved on-time departure performance for airlines.

Follow Johnny on Instagram www.instagram.com/johnny.harris/

Help us make more ambitious videos by joining the Vox Video Lab: http://bit.ly/video-lab

Maps are flat representations of our spherical planet. Johnny Harris cut open a plastic globe to understand just what it takes to turn a sphere into something flat.

His struggle to make a flat map out of the plastic globe is indicative of a challenge mapmakers have faced for centuries: It is mathematically impossible to translate the surface of a sphere onto a plane without some form of distortion.

To solve this problem, mathematicians and cartographers have developed a huge library of representations of the globe, each distorting a certain attribute and preserving others.

For instance, the Mercator projection preserves the shape of countries while distorting the size, especially near the north and south pole.

For a more accurate view of land area look at the Gall-Peters projection, which preserves area while distorting shape.

In the end, there's not ""right"" map projection. Each comes with trade-offs, and cartographers make projection decisions based on the particular tasks at hand. But if you are interested in seeing an accurate depiction of the planet, it's best to stick with a globe.

jBqoH-qx-os,Vox,UCLXo7UDZvByw2ixzpQCufnA,Why blackface is still part of Dutch holidays,2016-12-01 16:30:27+00:00,"The debate over Zwarte Piet (Black Pete), explained.

Subscribe to our channel! http://goo.gl/0bsAjO

This year, like every year, people will take to the streets across the Netherlands and Belgium to celebrate holiday festivities by dressing up as St. Nicholas and his ""assistant,"" Black Pete. And like every year, people will put on blackface — including big red lips and afro wigs — to portray Black Pete.

According to the legend, St. Nicholas (Sinterklaas in Dutch) lives in Spain, arrives in Holland by boat every year with a team of black assistants in tow, and spends a month delivering presents to children across the country. Ever since the release of a children’s book in 1850, however, that myth has included a black caricature named Zwarte Piet, or Black Pete.

So is Black Pete racist? Clearly, yes. I spent part of my childhood in Belgium, growing up with this tradition, and I’ve heard a lot of excuses that try to justify continuing the tradition. Some people say Black Pete doesn’t have black skin; instead, he’s just covered in soot from delivering presents through the chimney. Others say he’s St. Nicholas’s friend, and has never been a slave caricature. But historically, none of the defenses really hold up.

Change is happening, slowly. Though a 2014 decision to remove Black Pete from Amsterdam’s Sinterklaas parade was overturned in a higher court, city parade organizers have taken it upon themselves to gradually remove Black Pete’s racist characteristics from celebrations.

One of the ways they’ve done that is by introducing Chimney Pete, an alternative interpretation of the character without the Afro wig, earrings, or exaggerated lips — and with only a bit of soot dusted on his face. Half of all performers at the 2015 Amsterdam festival were Chimney Petes, and the plan was to boost that number to 75 percent for 2016. But in a surprise announcement, the city decided to replace all Black Petes with Chimney Petes for the 2016 holidays.

These efforts are still being met with resistance. In November 2017, pro-Zwarte Piet protesters obstructed highway access into Dokkum to block anti-Zwarte Piet protesters, even though the city had given them permission to demonstrate peacefully. The protest, which the mayor subsequently forbade out of concern about riots, has since been rescheduled with higher police presence.

Subscribe to our channel! http://goo.gl/0bsAjO

Many Americans are under the impression that sweet potatoes and yams are the same classic Thanksgiving dish — but the truth is that the two root vegetables are nothing alike. They look and taste completely different, hail from different parts of the world, and in the US you can’t even find yams at most conventional grocery stores.

Then why do so many American stores label sweet potatoes as yams? The misnomer is partly due to branding strategy, and partly due to a specific evolution of language — one that stems from the slave trade.

Subscribe to our channel! http://goo.gl/0bsAjO

Zip codes were invented in 1963 to help the United States Postal Service deal with huge increases in mail volume. The Zone Improvement Plan, or “ZIP” code system of addressing, organized mail delivery by dividing the country into 10 regions and assigning five digits increasing in specificity: from region to large sorting centers to smaller post offices. To promote the new system, the USPS released publicity materials featuring Mr. Zip, a cartoon character, and a song about zip codes from a band called The Swingin’ Six. 

As the nation grew, the USPS updated zip codes by adding a four-digit suffix in 1983. The new suffix corresponds to specific destinations, such as one side of a street or a certain floor of an office building. Now, geocoding technology has created the possibility of even more specific addressing.

A street is a road but a road isn't always a street. A road can also be an avenue or a boulevard—it's the general term for anything that connects two points. From there, the names of roads can be shaped by their environment and/or the form of the road. A drive is a long winding road that can be shaped by mountains or a lake. Place is a narrow road with no throughway. And just as there is no rule book to building a city, these roads and other don't always correspond with their described classifications.

Subscribe to our channel! http://goo.gl/0bsAjO

In 1788, Thomas Jefferson wrote that American women shouldn’t ""wrinkle their foreheads with politics."" A century and a half later, when Hillary Clinton was born, that attitude still prevailed.

That year, 1947, the US had zero female senators, zero female governors. The Supreme Court, and the Oval Office of course, had only ever seen men. It was only really in the past 40 years that women learned they could lead and men learned they could be led by women.

That revolution in American culture is still ongoing, but the idea that women are naturally unfit for government is now so alien to younger generations that many feel uncomfortable even considering the gender of a political candidate. The realities, however, lag behind the attitudes. Women make up only about 20 percent of the US House and the US Senate, and about 25 percent of state government.

Before 2008, no woman had come close to being nominated for president on a major party ticket. Before 2016, no woman had come close to winning the presidency. But Hillary Clinton is not the only trailblazer on the long path toward someday breaking America’s 240-year, 58-election streak of male presidents.

Through the '70s, '80s, and '90s, women in politics underwent the rocky process of teaching the country that they could be equally effective and competent leaders as men, a process that occurred in parallel at workplaces around the country. They dismantled stereotypes, named and condemned sexual harassment, and slowly erased the novelty of female decision-makers, at least at the legislative level. Their work is our inheritance.

Donald Trump’s nearness to the presidency rests on two separate accomplishments — or, if you prefer, two separate institutional failures — that are often conflated. The first is his victory in the Republican Party’s presidential primaries. The second is his consolidation of elite Republicans, and of the Republican-leaning electorate. But it's important to zoom out, and make a structural analysis of what allowed these things to happen.  And believe it or not, that’s where things get scary.

On November 4, 2016, the National Socialist Movement gathered for a rally in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania. The event was four days before the US presidential election and featured speeches given by NSM commander Jeff Schoep and National commander of the America First Committee, Arthur J. Jones Jr. At the rally, leaders discussed how Donald Trump's presidential campaign has brought white supremacism into the mainstream and legitimized their beliefs. Mark Potok from the Southern Poverty Law Center contextualizes the event with his discussion of how Trump has created political space for extremists by courting the support and validating the beliefs of groups on the alt-right. The rally closed with discussion of how the neo-Nazi groups plan to organize a show of force on Election Day.","['Neo-Nazism', 'Nazi', 'Nazis', 'Nazism', 'Jeff Schoep', 'National Socialist Movement', 'Arthur J.

The Democratic Party is the longest-existing political party in the US, and arguably the world. But in its over 180 year existence, it's completed a remarkable ideological and geographic transformation. Originally a staunch defender of Southern slavery, the party now wins the support of most nonwhite voters. Once an advocate of rural interests against coastal elites, the party now draws much of its strength from cities and coastal areas. This video tells the tale of the Democratic Party's origins, its various metamorphoses, and the sources of its strength — and weaknesses — today.

Subscribe to our channel! http://goo.gl/0bsAjO

Donald Trump’s coziness with Vladimir Putin, casual talk of taking Iraq’s oil and abandoning NATO, and muddled messaging on whether he'd deploy American troops to battle ISIS makes it easy to assume that the GOP nominee's foreign policy is a jumbled mishmash of ideas lacking any coherent philosophy.

That couldn't be more wrong. In fact, a close look at Trump’s public comments leads to a very different conclusion: Trump has a distinct worldview that knits together many of his specific proposals. We can sum it up in a word: transactional.

More from Andrew Prokop on how much presidential debates matter for the general election.
http://www.vox.com/2016/9/12/12847632/debates-trump-clinton-polls-political-science

And it’s not just the presidential race. Betting markets now predict Democrats will win the Senate. This is not normal. As Andrew Prokop concluded in his review of the political science evidence around presidential debates, “There’s little historical evidence that they’ve ever swung polls by more than a few percentage points.” Two things have been true throughout the debates. One is that Trump has been, at every turn, underprepared, undisciplined, and operating completely without a strategy. But the other reality is that Clinton has been, at every turn, prepared, disciplined, and coldly strategic. This has been consistent from the first presidential debate, to the third and final presidential debate, which was hosted by Fox News.

Translating the Harry Potter books written by J.K. Rowling, in over 60 languages around the world, was not for the faint of heart or vocabulary. 

Translators didn't have advanced copies of the books to get a headstart and these books could take months to adapt from English. They also had to be clever in their solutions because the books are filled with wordplays, invented words, puns, British culture references, riddles, and more. 

The longest book, Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix, at 870 pages was published June 21, 2003. The first translation of it was ready July 21, 2003. Translators had to work day and night to have them ready for eager readers. Even then, fans still banded together to create illegal translations of the series.

The presidential debates have become major media events, but a decreasing share of Americans are watching them. Although that proportion slightly increased for the first debate between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton, the proportion of voting-age Americans watching isn't nearly what it was during the 1970s and 1980s.

Kathleen Hall Jamieson, President of the Annenberg Public Policy Center, and a working group of bipartisan former campaign advisers have developed a list of suggestions to fix what they believe is a flawed debate format. You can read the full report here: http://www.annenbergpublicpolicycenter.org/democratizing-the-debates/

Subscribe to our channel! http://goo.gl/0bsAjO

If you hold a pin at arm’s length up in the air, the head of the pin covers approximately the amount of sky that appears in the Hubble Deep Field. The iconic 1995 image is crowded, not because it’s a broad swath of sky but because it’s a broad swath of time. The Hubble Deep Field is more than 12 billion light-years deep.

Robert Williams was the director of the Hubble’s science institute back in 1995, and it was his decision to attempt a deep field observation with the telescope. Previous calculations had indicated that Hubble would not be able to detect very distant galaxies, but Williams figured they’d never know unless they tried.

His team chose a completely dark part of the sky, in order to see beyond the stars of the Milky Way, and programmed Hubble to stare at that spot for 10 days. It was unusual to use precious observing time to point the telescope at nothing in particular, but that’s what they did.

""We didn’t know what was there, and that was the whole purpose of the observation, basically — to get a core sample of the universe,"" Williams said, borrowing the concept of the ""core sample"" from the earth sciences. 

""You do the same thing if you're trying to understand the geology of the Earth: Pick some typical spot to drill down to try to understand exactly what the various layers of the Earth are and what they mean in terms of its geologic history.""

What makes the Hubble Deep Field an atypical core sample is that rather than observing the material as it is now, the telescope collected images of galaxies as they appeared millions and billions of years ago. Since light can only travel so fast, the telescope is a peephole into the history of the universe.

When there is talk about the gender wage gap, often the statistic heard is, “Women earn 79 cents for every dollar a man makes.”  While this is factually correct, it does not encompass the nuances of the wage gap. The answer is in the complexity of this problem. Career types and child-rearing duties are both in the equation to closing the gender wage gap.

Special thanks to Martin Connor. More of his hip hop analysis can be found here: http://www.rapanalysis.com/

A crisp and clear vocal performance is a vital component of all genres of popular music. So when Kanye West recorded his debut single, ""Through the Wire,"" with his jaw completely wired shut after a car accident, he was taking a huge risk.

When you listen to ""Through the Wire,"" you immediately hear that Kanye ""chipmunk soul"" in his pitched-up sample of Chaka Khan's ""Through the Fire."" But you also hear Kanye riff: Yo, Gee, they can’t stop me from rapping, can they? Can they, Hop?

His voice is muffled and lispy. It's not clear at all. But that vocal performance illustrates something unique about his work as a producer and artist: His greatest instrument has always been the human voice.

Here's a Spotify playlist for some select Kanye West tracks.

Subscribe to our channel! http://goo.gl/0bsAjO

In the 19th century, the moment one stopped breathing was the final indication of death, and a mirror held to the mouth, unfogged, was the indication that the soul had exited the body. Currently the measurement of death is a much more complicated one that involves a more industrialized and less religious view of the body: when mechanical and electrical activity ceases (the brain stops signaling, the heart stops beating and breath stops), one is pronounced dead. 

But as we increasingly peer into the body with more powerful tools, these markers of death might not really indicate a final end.

Fencing is split up into three different events based on the weapon used. There's the foil, epee, and sabre. They each have their own set of rules, and their roots can be traced back centuries.

Subscribe to our channel! http://goo.gl/0bsAjO

The ""freemium"" business model allows us to use an app for free with the option to purchase additional features. In the case of games, that model can fundamentally alter the user experience, from gaming to getting gamed.

By collecting troves of data on how users play their games, developers have mastered the science of applied addiction. And with the rise of ""freemium"" games that rely on micro-transactions, they have good reason to deploy the tools of behavioral psychology to inspire purchases.

In the video above, I spoke to Jamie Madigan, author of a blog, podcast, and book about the psychology of video games. We take a look at some of the mind tricks that some of these games use to convert players into payers.

Today’s Republican Party opposes big government. It’s culturally conservative. Its demographic support is strongest among white voters, and it usually dominates elections in the South. And its 2016 presidential nominee has been heavily criticized for inciting racial tensions.

But things weren’t always this way. 

Over the past 160 or so years, the party has undergone a remarkable transformation from the party of Abraham Lincoln… to the party of Donald Trump.

Many drivers are familiar with receiving the dreaded automated traffic enforcement photo for running a red light. While red light cameras have been reported to reduce broadside crashes, it has been shown these cameras increase rear-end collisions as well. In addition, numerous tickets aren't going to people running straight through red lights, but drivers failing to make a complete stop while turning on red. Safety is touted as the biggest concern but there are better long term solutions than municipalities installing red light cameras. Building more roundabouts and lengthening yellow lights are just two of several cheaper alternatives to red light cameras.

✉️ Sign up for our newsletter: http://www.vox.com/video-newsletter

There are several aquariums around the world, including one in Georgia, that house whale sharks, the biggest fish in the sea. But not one has a great white shark on display. 

Aquariums have made dozens of attempts since the 1970s to display a captive great white shark. Most of those attempts ended with dead sharks. 

By the 2000s, the only group still trying was the Monterey Bay Aquarium, which spent a decade planning its white shark program. In 2004, it acquired a shark that became the first great white to survive in captivity for more than 16 days. In fact, it was on display for more than six months before it was released back into the ocean. 

In the following years, the Monterey Bay Aquarium hosted five more juvenile white sharks for temporary stays before ending the program in 2011. It was an expensive effort and had come under criticism due to injuries that some of the sharks developed in the tank. 

Responding to those critics, Jon Hoech, the aquarium's director of husbandry operations, said: ""We believe strongly that putting people face to face with live animals like this is very significant in inspiring ocean conservation and connecting people to the ocean environment. We feel like white sharks face a significant threats out in the wild and our ability to bring awareness to that is significant in terms of encouraging people to become ocean stewards."" 

Check out the video above to learn why white sharks are so difficult to keep in captivity and how the Monterey Bay Aquarium designed a program that could keep them alive.

He also came up with the term survival of the fittest. This is how it happened...

Subscribe to our channel! http://goo.gl/0bsAjO

Immediately following an airplane crash anywhere in US territory, the National Transportation Safety Board dispatches a team of investigators to survey the wreckage, gather information from the airline and from air traffic control, and retrieve the plane's so-called ""black boxes.""

These flight recorders — one stores cockpit audio recordings, the other stores airplane instrument data — are sent to NTSB's lab in Washington, DC, for analysis. There, officials listen to what are sometimes the pilots' final, panicked moments of life. They interpret not only what the pilots were saying before the crash but also any snaps, bangs, and alarms captured by the cockpit area microphone.

By combining those audio clues with data from the plane's instruments and sensors, as well as evidence from the scene, investigators can usually determine the cause of the crash, even in cases with no surviving witnesses.

Truffles are the fruiting body of an ectomycorrhizal fungus and the one of most expensive things you can eat. Italian white truffles are renowned for their pungent smell and earthy taste. In general, truffles play by their own rules. Truffle sniffing dogs are needed to find the fungus. And cultivation has been difficult with black truffles and hasn't happened at all with white truffles. It's a journey filled with hunting, counterfeiting, and occasional night time heists to get truffles from the ground to being shaved over your pizza.

When Piotr Mlodozeniec designed the first Coexist logo, he had no idea how quickly — and how far — it would spread. His design for Museum on the Seam became iconic, and it was also closely copied by a designer t-shirt company, worn by U2s Bono on stage, and aped by hippie bumper sticker makers — all without his permission. This is how it happened and what the Coexist logo really means.

The GIF was invented in 1989. And since its beginning, the GIF has been used to make money. At first, GIFs were sold as placeholders for the web of the '90s and early 2000s. But after web design became informed by professional standards, gifs lost their role as placeholders. Eventually they became tools of expression, turning snippets of video from popular culture into bite size communication devices. Today, a few big tech companies are trying to capitalize on this new use of GIFs, partnering with brands who want their content to be used as communication.

Vox's Phil Edwards learned about the early battles between the car and horse. Follow Phil Edwards and Vox Almanac on Facebook for more: https://www.facebook.com/voxalmanac

This marketing conflict from the early 1900s may show how a battle between self-driving cars and traditional cars could play out.

As we look ahead to a public conversation about the merits of self-driving cars over traditionally driven ones, the horse and car battle may prove to be prescient. New technologies aren't easily accepted — and sometimes even a superior product has to adopt fierce tactics to win.

And despite the car's shortcomings, the horse really did create a lot of problems that automobiles could fix. Horse manure was a serious public health hazard; thousands of horses were maltreated (and as many died); and, of course, horses had less acceleration and braking power than the car, resulting in slowdowns and accidents.

One ingredient has been a staple in sushi for over a thousand years—but it began in southeast Asia as a fish preservation method. Farmers would catch fish in rice paddies during the monsoon season. The caught fish were then pickled by salting the entire fish, packing it with cooked rice and weights, and sealing it in a barrel. This method helped prevent the fish from spoiling and gave the fish umami, the savory flavor. It wasn’t until this preservation method made its way to Japan, during the 8th century, did the rice began to be eaten with the fish.

If you've ever wondered about the history of running, jogging, and even treadmills, it turns out to be a lot more surprising than you might expect. Thanks to dedicated runners and influential leaders like Bill Bowerman, running is mainstream — but it wasn't always that way.

Subscribe to our channel! http://goo.gl/0bsAjO

The 48,000 miles of interstate highway that would be paved across the country during the 1950s, '60s, and '70s were a godsend for many rural communities. But those highways also gutted many cities, with whole neighborhoods torn down or isolated by huge interchanges and wide ribbons of asphalt. Wealthier residents fled to the suburbs, using the highways to commute back in by car. That drained the cities' tax bases and hastened their decline.

So why did cities help build the expressways that would so profoundly decimate them? 

The answer involves a mix of self-interested industry groups, design choices made by people far away, a lack of municipal foresight, and outright institutional racism.

This Mother's Day, if your mom is still with you, give her a call and ask her what motherhood meant to her, and what advice she has for you. We think you'll be glad you did.

Childbirth is a really common procedure in the US. Around 4 million women will go to a hospital this year. And most births are relatively uncomplicated. But even for the most common medical procedure in the US, the price for labor and delivery is almost impossible to find out before it happens. I decided to try it out--to see if I could get a number of how much my wife's birth would cost before it happened. This video is the story of what happened.

Subscribe to our channel! http://goo.gl/0bsAjO

Of late, the media has become convinced that Donald Trump is going to reinvent himself as a sensible moderate as he transitions to becoming a general election candidate.  ""When I'm president, I'm a different person,"" he told a crowd back in January. ""I can be the most politically correct person you've ever seen.""

No, he can't.

In 1990, Donald Trump gave an interview to Playboy magazine. Read today, it stands as an astonishing testament to Trump's consistency. Nearly every sentence of it is something Trump could have said today. But that's not to say it's devoid of insights. Toward the end, Trump offers his philosophy of life, of governance, and of international competitiveness.

""People need ego, whole nations need ego,"" he told Playboy. ""I think our country needs more ego, because it is being ripped off so badly by our so-called allies; i.e., Japan, West Germany, Saudi Arabia, South Korea, etc. They have literally outegotized this country.""

Defense Secretary Ash Carter, as he comes into what could be his last year overseeing the most powerful military on earth, has begun talking about something surprising: a return to great power competition. During a recent interview at the Pentagon, we asked Carter how he thought about navigating this new world, and he returned over and over to the same answer: deterrence.

But as the norms and tools of warfare are changing, how well does deterrence still work? Can this Cold War-era idea still keep the peace in a new era? Here's why this challenge has such high stakes for the world — and what Carter had to say about it.

Though we're familiar with pneumatic tubes from banks, they've been around much longer and used for a lot more.

Video by Gina Barton and Liz Scheltens

Millions of Americans suffer from seasonal allergies. There isn’t a clear-cut answer as to why some people have them while others don’t but scientists do have one particular theory. The hygiene hypothesis is the idea that excessively sterile environments are contributing to the development of allergies, asthma, and other autoimmune illnesses. Kids in wealthy countries lack exposure to allergens and other germs that aid in developing a healthy and functioning immune system. While the hygiene hypothesis isn’t the definitive answer to seasonal allergies, it is a starting point.

The modern April Fools' Day ritual has already begun — you have to figure out which stories are legitimate and which ones are pranks.

As the above video shows, it wasn't always this way. The media used to be the victim of pranks, not the perpetrator. But thanks to a watershed prank by the BBC (and a few merry pranksters before that), April Fools' Day has begun a universally loved (or loathed) part of our daily reading.

“The robot” is one of the world’s most recognizable novelty dances. Its distinctive popping and locking motions are simple enough concepts in themselves but the origins of the robot are little less straightforward. The word robot was first used in the 1921 play Rossumovi Univerzální Roboti (Rossum’s Universal Robots). There was a time the dance wasn’t set to music and it was part of a mime. Robert Shields included this robot mime his routine in the late 60s. This novelty act caught the eye of Charles Washington, many other performers, including the Jackson 5. From there, the robot solidified its mechanical but flexible movements in dancing history.

Vestigial structures are evolution's leftovers — body parts that, through inheritance, have outlived the context in which they arose. Some of the most delightful reminders of the common ancestry we share with other animals, they show that the building blocks of the human body predate our species by hundreds of millions of years.

Forty-two percent of Americans say that humans were created in their present form within the past 10,000 years — a percentage that hasn't changed much since 1982, when Gallup started polling views on evolution.

Several lines of evidence, from the fossil record, comparative anatomy, and genetics, tell another story. But you don't have to read all the research to find signs of our evolutionary history — you can see it in the vestigial structures in each of our bodies, like the third molars that no longer fit in our mouths. For a few other examples, check out the video above.

ocUNn6KUN6k,Vox,UCLXo7UDZvByw2ixzpQCufnA,Why people never smiled in old photos,2016-03-10 14:51:52+00:00,"Early portraits looked pretty grim.

A lot of old photos from the 19th and early 20th century are fraught with doom and gloom—and on the occasion the literal dead face. That led to the popular belief that people just did not smile in old photographs. The common explanation is due to the limited technology at the time to capture a smile.

Subscribe to our channel! http://goo.gl/0bsAjO

If you steal $600 worth of merchandise, the police will probably come after you. But if your employer steals $600 of your wages, you are likely to never see that money again.

And chances are high that you have experienced wage theft yourself, whether you work a 9-to-5 job or are an independent contractor. The Economic Policy Institute estimates that wage theft is costing US workers $50 billion a year. And even though New York has one of the strongest wage theft protection laws on the books, it is actually very difficult to enforce those laws in practice. According to a 2015 report from the Center for Popular Democracy, ""2.1 million New Yorkers are victims of wage theft annually and are cheated out of cumulative $3.2 billion in wages and benefits they are owed."" A recent survey by the Freelancers Union found that 71 percent of freelancers have had difficulty getting paid and that the average loss per freelancer is approximately $6,000 a year.

One large group that is especially hard hit by seemingly endemic nonpayment issues is day laborers. This workforce is predominantly composed of immigrants who tend to work sporadically without written contracts. And women are especially vulnerable: ""Not only do women day laborers earn significantly less than their male counterparts but they also tend to experience bigger challenges in providing legal evidence in cases of wage theft,"" Maria Figueroa, director of labor and policy research at the Industrial and Labor Relations School of Cornell University, told us in an email exchange.

Black people are rarely featured in sci-fi and fantasy films — that is, unless that black person is Will Smith. How do black people get to exist in the future?

Subscribe to our channel! http://goo.gl/0bsAjO

We live in a country with a two-party system. We only get two real choices (usually) when it's time to pick a president. This means the people who pick each party's nominee play a hugely important role.

So who are these people?

For starters, it's a small group. Just 20 percent of American adults vote in presidential primaries. They tend to be older, whiter, and better-educated than your average general election voter.

Primary voters also tend to be highly partisan, which helps explain why ideas at the fringes of each party (free college for all, a giant wall along the Mexican-US border) gain traction during the primaries.

Primaries in the US are also sequential; rather than everyone voting on the same day, some states have their primaries early in the year, some later (for more on why, check out our previous videos). Unless you live in a state with an early primary, there's a good chance your party will already have a nominee by the time your state gets around to voting, meaning your vote is basically meaningless.

You can see this whole dynamic playing out right now. Donald Trump did well in Iowa and New Hampshire, carried that momentum into Nevada and South Carolina, and now looks likely to win a majority of the Super Tuesday contests. When the general election comes around, the people in those states can know they had a voice in whom their party nominated. The rest of us are out of luck.

Check back next week for the final episode in our series Vox Explains the Primaries. We'll explore the proliferation of strict voter ID laws that civil rights advocates say are disenfranchising hundreds of thousands of Americans.

Subscribe to our channel! http://goo.gl/0bsAjO

This fact has been vexing humans for centuries: Earth's year (one orbit around the sun) isn't neatly divisible by its day (one rotation about its axis). One full orbit takes more than 365 days but less than 366.

That's not surprising — there's no reason for the two to be linked. The trouble comes when we try to overlay a useful calendar onto this random system. And as a result, our annual calendar is always slightly wrong.

Leap year is our jury-rigged solution to this problem. To nudge our calendar closer to accuracy, we simply stick an extra day at the end of February every four years. Without it, our calendar would slowly shift further and further from the true year.

But technically, we should only add 97 percent of a day. Sounds close enough but after a century, we've overcorrected the calendar by nearly a day, so there are additional ""rules."" Science writer Phil Plait shows all the frustrating math on this, but here's the takeaway:

If the year is divisible by 4, then it’s a leap year, UNLESS

it’s also divisible by 100, then it’s not a leap year, UNLESS FURTHER

the year is divisible by 400, then it is a leap year.

And even after all these adjustments, the calendar will gradually shift over millennia. February 29, then, is an occasion to mark the indifference of space. The chaotic formation of the solar system gave rise to Earth's life-friendly orbit and rotation. Only billions of years later did the resulting creatures try to coordinate their schedules.

Political journalists and pundits are in a tizzy over the possibility of a brokered GOP convention this summer. Instead of the scripted snooze-fests we're used to, we could see the kind of backroom deals and delegate-swapping that once characterized party conventions.

But what, exactly, is a brokered convention?

A brokered convention happens when no single candidate has a majority (51 percent) of delegates on the first round of balloting. Even if Donald Trump wins more delegates than any other candidate, if he doesn't hit that magic number (1,237) on the first round, there'll be a second ballot.

That's where things can get interesting. During the second ballot, delegates from opposing camps try to convince one another to change sides. That's what happened at the 1948 GOP convention. It took three rounds of voting and horse-trading for the delegates to coalesce around Thomas Dewey.

This year, a brokered convention could be the only hope for an establishment candidate like Marco Rubio. Trump and Ted Cruz have been dominating the primary polls, but are unpopular among general election voters.

As a result, Politico reporter Ben Schreckinger writes, GOP insiders are preparing for the ""white whale"" of politics, a brokered convention. Delegates are ""bound"" to candidates during the first round of voting based on the results of their state's primary, but if the first ballot is inconclusive, the delegates can support a different candidate.

We hardly ever see this kind of action anymore. That's because the front-loaded primary calendar usually ensures that winners get momentum and losers drop out months before the parties gather for their conventions. But in 2016, this piece of conventional wisdom, like so many others, seems to have gone out the window.","['brokered convention', '2016 election', 'primary', 'delegates']",none,152.0,hd,true,174378.0,1981.0,343.0,Tuesday,4

Trump is in serious contention to win the Republican presidential nomination. His triumph in a general election is unlikely, but it is far from impossible. He's not a joke and he's not a clown.

Subscribe to our channel! http://goo.gl/0bsAjO

Bernie Sanders and Donald Trump both speak with a New York City accent. And Queens College linguist Michael Newman thinks it might be good for their brand. Writing in the New York Times, he said:

""Americans have come to associate New Yorkers, and so New York accents, with saying what you mean, intense emotional talk and not worrying too much about whom you offend.""

But the larger pattern outside this year's presidential race is that the New York City accent is stigmatized, and its most distinctive features are fading.

That's why Bernie Sanders provides such an interesting case study. He was born in 1941 and raised in a lower-middle-class household in a Jewish part of Brooklyn. Even though he's now spent more of his life in Vermont than in New York, his voice tells a story of his past and the past of the nation's greatest city.

The presidential primaries effect us all. So why does it seem like it's decided by a few random people in the middle of nowhere?

Well, technically, it's not. Delegates are, for the most part, awarded based on population, and are selected by primary voters or caucus-goers in all 50 states.

But that's not the whole story. Timing matters, and it matters a ton. Voters in Iowa and New Hampshire, who have already voted, basically end up having votes that are five times as powerful than the rest of us.

The power of the media, and how people respond to earlier results, make a huge difference. A win in Iowa or New Hampshire can give candidates momentum in later states, and a loss can force others to drop out before most states even vote. Which means if you live in a state with a later primary, your vote really doesn't matter much.

Iowa and New Hampshire like going first. Voters there reward politicians who promise to let them keep going first. Both states even have laws that require them to schedule their nominating contests before any other states.

So how come there isn't a national primary day, so our votes are really equal?

Watch our new video above and these squirrelly little legos will explain. If you'd like more, a couple other installments of our primaries series are here. And stay tuned next Tuesday, when we'll explain who votes in Presidential primaries.

The Apollo 7 mission is the only time NASA says the sweet stuff flew. So we asked Apollo 7 Lunar Module Pilot Walt Cunnningham if it was true. The answer might surprise you.

Space food in general has a fascinating and complicated history, even without the ice cream. Take a look at Neil Armstrong's fruitcake.

Iran is about to hold a national election that could shape the country's future for a generation — potentially even more so than the presidential elections in 2009, when ""green movement"" protests signaled public outrage with the regime, and in 2013, when voters elevated the moderate Hassan Rouhani on a promise of economic and diplomatic opening.

On February 26, Iranians will vote for candidates for their parliament and for a body called the Assembly of Experts — which, though few outside Iran have heard of it, could be in a position to radically alter Iran's politics.

Right now, presidential candidates are crisscrossing the country, begging primary voters for their support. But it's easy to forget that not too long ago, these voters had no say in whom their party nominated for president.

In the nation's early days, members of Congress picked their party's nominee. And for most of the 19th and 20th centuries, party bosses told delegates at the convention which candidate to support, and everybody else found out in the papers and on TV.

But everything changed after the Democratic National Convention in 1968. Watch our video to see why.

Check back next week to find out why we have the weird primary schedule that basically disenfranchises millions.

Subscribe to our channel! http://goo.gl/0bsAjO

Since the late 1990s, the virtual yellow line has been quietly enhancing football broadcasts by giving viewers a live, intuitive guide to the state of play. The graphic is engineered to appear painted on the field, rather than simply plopped on top of the players, so it doesn't distract from the game at all.

The line debuted during a September 27, 1998, game between the Baltimore Ravens and the Cincinnati Bengals. It was developed by a company called Sportvision Inc. and operated by six people in a 48-foot semi-truck parked outside the stadium. 

ESPN was the only network that immediately agreed to pay the steep price of $25,000 per game. Before long, other companies began offering the yellow line to the other networks, and now you won't see a football game without it.

Three years ago, the Zika virus was nowhere to be found in the Western Hemisphere. To date, the largest outbreak occurred in French Polynesia in 2013 with 383 reported cases. But in 2015, Brazil suddenly found itself with an unprecedented Zika outbreak. More than a million people have been infected by the mosquito-transmitted—and potentially sexually transmitted disease. 

The mosquito-borne virus doesn't seem to harm most of its victims. But there's increasing evidence that it can cause serious damage to the brains of fetuses and, in rare instances, devastating neurological problems in adults.

Step 2: Understand the power of light
Step 3: Get comfortable with herbs

Subscribe to our channel! http://goo.gl/0bsAjO

One of the biggest myths about the Israel-Palestine conflict is that it's been going on for centuries, that this is all about ancient religious hatreds.

In fact, while religion is involved, the conflict is mostly about two groups of people who claim the same land. And it really only goes back about a century, to the early 1900s. At its heart, it is a conflict between two self-determination movements — the Jewish Zionist project and the Palestinian nationalist project — that lay claim to the same territory.

Vox's Phil Edwards investigates the real Δ.

The Illuminati is fascinating, but is it real? This is the history of the real group, including everything from the Freemasons to Dan Brown. If you've heard about the group, you've probably wondered: what is the real illuminati? Conspiracy theories like ""illuminati confirmed"" have confused the issue, so here are the illuminati facts about the history of the group.

It is immigrants, and their descendants, who largely make up today's US population. European immigrants were the first and largest group to arrive, and there were subsequent policies that made it much easier for people from those countries to come to the US. That said, a decent numbers of Canadian and Chinese immigrants also arrived early in this country's history, and over the years, different policies allowed greater numbers of Hispanics and Asians to immigrate.

His gender-fluid performances, a space-cover of ""Space Oddity,"" his role in the fall of the Berlin wall, we've written a lot about Bowie at Vox:http://www.vox.com/2016/1/11/10749394/david-bowie-dead-songs-legacy

But one thing that will always travel forward now that David Bowie is gone, is his music. Countless celebrities poured on about his influence yesterday, but we also can track those who directly documented his influence in quotations or sampled his music.

Of course, the video above is nowhere near a complete documentation. For even more, you can check out the incredible resource Who Sampled, which inspired a few of the choices in the video, and lists hundreds more.  http://www.whosampled.com/David-Bowie/?sp=1

Thousands of law enforcement officers are stationed in American schools — and they're a key part of the ""school-to-prison pipeline,"" which places students into the criminal justice system for matters of school discipline. 

It started in the 90s, when schools began responding to rising crime rates with zero-tolerance policies. There were originally put in place to stop weapons and drugs from entering schools and to prevent tragedies like Columbine—these policies extended beyond to include smaller infractions such as uniform violations, talking back, insubordination, etc.

Schools in Oakland, California are exploring new ways to break the school-to-prison pipeline. These schools practice restorative justice where both parties talk out their issues instead of administrators suspending or expelling students.

Subscribe to our channel! http://goo.gl/0bsAjO

After hearing a trickle of reports about food poisoning over recent months, millions of lunch-seeking Americans are probably wondering: Is it safe to eat at Chipotle?

The bad news is that public health investigators haven't identified the source of the E. coli that sickened almost 60 Chipotle customers in 11 states. By the time they started testing the restaurants and the employees, they couldn't find a trace of the bacteria.

But that may be a blessing in disguise because without a specific ingredient or supplier to blame, Chipotle has to inspect everything.

Spurred by repeated cases of food poisoning in the past six months — not just from E. coli, but also norovirus (caused by sick workers) and Salmonella (caused by contaminated tomatoes) —Chipotle announced an ambitious food-safety plan that, if implemented, could make Chipotle one of the safer fast food chains out there.

When Republican governors call for a ban on Syrian refugees, or Donald Trump calls for a ban on all Muslims, Mormons tend to identify with this religious discrimination, a sentiment echoed by Gov. Herbert in a recent Facebook post:
""I am the governor of a state that was settled by religious exiles who withstood persecution after persecution, including an extermination order from another state's governor. In Utah, the First Amendment still matters. That will not change so long as I remain governor.""

About once a month, there's a new logo to fight about on the internet. The biggest one in recent memory was the highly controversial Hillary Clinton logo, which did not escape scrutiny from Vox.com either. 

But as a designer/filmmaker, something about these repeated discussions struck me as missing the point on what makes logos tick. It often has little to do with the subjective musings. So I called up Michael Bierut, the designer of that Hillary Clinton logo and countless others. He sat down with me and helped explain the elements of a great logo in the video above.

In the few short years since the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria formed, it has done the seemingly impossible, seizing vast areas of the Middle East to form a mini-state it calls a reincarnation of the ancient Caliphate. It is at war with all its neighbors and virtually the entire world, yet someone remains, and is launching increasingly deadly terror attacks abroad.

To understand how this terrible group came about and how it has grown so powerful, you need to understand the story behind its rise. And that is a story that goes back decades, to long before ISIS existed.

El Niño is a weather phenomenon that occurs irregularly in the eastern tropical Pacific every two to seven years. When the trade winds that usually blow from east to west weaken, sea surface temperatures start rising, setting off a chain of atmospheric impacts.

El Niños can be strong or weak. Strong events can temporarily disrupt weather patterns around the world, typically making certain regions wetter (Peru or California, say) and others drier (Southeast Asia). Some countries suffer major damage as a result.

El Niños also transfer heat stored in the deeper layers of the ocean to the surface. When combined with global warming, that can lead to record hot years, as in 1998.

Countries across the globe will have to brace themselves as this event peaks this winter and lasts through the spring. El Niño has already triggered longer droughts in Indonesia, enabling massive man-made peatland fires to rage out of control, creating toxic haze that has spread as far as Singapore. Warmer ocean temperatures have also caused a major coral bleaching event, harming reefs around the world.

Subscribe to our channel! http://goo.gl/0bsAjO

One of the common mistakes people make about climate change is saying that it’s about “saving the planet.” But that’s not really the right way to think about it.

Earth has gone through immense climate changes many times before, in some cases leading to mass species extinction. Now, we’re living through the onset of human-caused climate change, and slowing it down isn’t about saving the Earth. It’s about saving ourselves. 

Humans have been around for just .004% of Earth’s history. And in all of human history – the 200,000 years since our species began – we’ve had agriculture for just 5% of that time and  electricity for .07% of that time. 

The simple truth about climate change is that it isn’t new to the planet, but civilization is. And with climate change we’re inviting a level of climate disruption that human civilization has simply never seen before.

Outlet stores began in the 1930s as a place for excess and damaged goods to be sold employees. As outlet stores grew they began offering the same goods to non-employees.

Today, shoppers believe they can purchase excess designer clothes from last season at a good price in outlet stores like Nordstrom Rack or Saks OFF 5TH. Wrong. The little-known truth about outlet stores is that most of their merchandise was actually made to sell only at outlets.

Some brands—including Kate Spade New York, Michael Kors, Gap, Banana Republic— are being sued for their misleading retail price comparison on the merchandise tag.

By Eléonore Hamelin 

When I asked the children of 9/11 victims if they would be interested in sending a message to Paris and victims of terrorism, they were up for it. They wanted to tell the people of Paris that, unfortunately, they’re not alone. But no matter how hard it is, you can overcome fear and terror. As much as most of these kids were resistant to it, the 9/11 attacks became a part of their identity. By embracing this identity, these now young adults have become symbols of hope and resilience.

When terrorists attacked New York City in 2001, Terrease Aiken, now 22, was 8; Juliette Candela, 21, was 6; Francesca Picerno, 23, was 9; and Joseph Palombo, 26, was 12

Subscribe to our channel! http://goo.gl/0bsAjO

If you write things on the internet, angry email is inevitable. If you make charts on the internet, angry email about those charts is inevitable. Especially if your charts sometimes use a y-axis that starts at a number other than zero. You see, an old book called How to Lie With Statistics has convinced people that truncated axes are a devilish tool of deception.

The truth is that you certainly can use truncated axes to deceive. But you can also use them to illuminate. In fact you often have to mess with the y-axis in order to craft a useful image -- especially because data sometimes reachers into negative territory and sometimes goes nowhere near zero. The right principle is that charts aught to show appropriate context. Sometimes that context includes zero, but sometimes it doesn't. It's long past time to say no to Y-axis Fundamentalism.

On Decemeber 14th, NASA will begin accepting applications for astronauts—the application will be available on the USA Jobs web site. The basic requirements to qualify for the position aren't as unattainable as some may believe. Some of the basic requirements to join NASA's elite astronaut corps include: having a bachelor's degree in engineering, biological science, physical science, or mathematics, plus 3 years of related professional experience, or at least 1,000 hours as pilot of a jet aircraft. 

There are currently 47 active astronauts in the space agency's corps. In a press release, NASA said, ""The next class of astronauts may fly on any of four different U.S. vessels during their careers: the International Space Station, two commercial crew spacecraft currently in development by U.S. companies, and NASA’s Orion deep-space exploration vehicle.""

NASA expects to announce selected candidates in mid-2017.

When Voyager 1 and Voyager 2 launched into space in 1977, their mission was to explore the outer solar system, and over the following decade, they did so admirably.

With an 8-track tape memory system and onboard computers that are thousands of times weaker than the phone in your pocket, the two spacecraft sent back an immense amount of imagery and information about the four gas giants, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune.

But NASA knew that after the planetary tour was complete, the Voyagers would remain on a trajectory toward interstellar space, having gained enough velocity from Jupiter's gravity to eventually escape the grasp of the sun. Since they will orbit the Milky Way for the foreseeable future, the Voyagers should carry a message from their maker, NASA scientists decided.

The Voyager team tapped famous astronomer and science popularizer Carl Sagan to compose that message. Sagan's committee chose a copper phonograph LP as their medium, and over the course of six weeks they produced the ""Golden Record"": a collection of sounds and images that will probably outlast all human artifacts on Earth.

Cuba’s economy works as a central planning model, where government ministries dole out resources and set everything from prices to inventories to salaries. The fact that a taxi driver can make so much more than a physician is a reflection of the Cuban government’s heavy focus on tourism. For years, the central planning apparatus has valued tourism as a key mechanism for both bringing in revenue as well as propagating the idea that Cuba is thriving. Many pesos are collected by the high prices on everything related to the tourism industry.

It's counterintuitive, but scientists agree that drinking coffee before napping will give you a stronger boost of energy than either coffee or napping alone. To understand a coffee nap, you have to understand how caffeine affects you. After it's absorbed through your small intestine and passes into your bloodstream, it crosses into your brain. There, it fits into receptors that are normally filled by a similarly shaped molecule called adenosine. Adenosine is a byproduct of brain activity, and when it accumulates at high enough levels, it plugs into these receptors and makes you feel tired. But with the caffeine blocking the receptors, it's unable to do so. Here's the trick of the coffee nap: sleeping naturally clears adenosine from the brain. So if you nap for those 20 minutes, you'll reduce your levels of adenosine just in time for the caffeine to kick in. The caffeine will have less adenosine to compete with, and will thereby be even more effective in making you alert.

Subscribe to our channel! http://goo.gl/0bsAjO


On September 11, 2012, a partially armed group of men stormed a US diplomatic outpost in the Libyan city of Benghazi. At the time, it was not clear who they were or why they'd attacked. But by the time the attack was over, four Americans, including US Ambassador to Libya Christopher Stevens, had been killed.

The attack ended by the early hours of September 12. But it has echoed in Washington ever since. The controversy has centered on Republican accusations that the Obama administration did not take heed of intelligence warnings before the attack, that during the attack it refused to call in available military support, and that after the attack it deliberately covered up what had happened.

Repeated independent investigations have disproven all of these allegations. But Republicans have continued to push them, insisting that these failures go all the way to the top, personally involving President Obama and then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. They've done so partly out political expediency — they think it's a great way to attack Clinton's presidential campaign — and partly out of a genuine belief that the administration is covering up the truth.

But regardless of the motivation, it's kind of paid off for Republicans: The House Select Committee on Benghazi, created by Speaker of the House John Boehner in 2014, found the first documented evidence that Clinton used unauthorized private email servers for State Department business, which became a major scandal. Unless Clinton is defeated in the Democratic primary, Benghazi will be around for the rest of the 2016 election — and if she wins, you'll likely be hearing about it for much longer.

Cuba has some of the worst internet access in the world, with just 5 percent of Cubans able to access the uncensored web.

Since the communist revolution of 1959, the Castro regime has enforced a strict ban on all forms of information flow that challenge official policy and history. Enforcing such censorship has been relatively easy for an island nation that has a monopoly over all media outlets. But when the internet arrived in the '90s, it complicated matters for the Castro's.

As Cubans get a taste for the wonder that is the internet, they want more. As internal pressure grows, the Cuban regime will likely continue to find creative ways to offer the internet without losing control of the flow of information. The opening of Cuba to foreign investment and travel will only speed up the process.

The Simpsons just entered it's 27th season and has been renewed for a 28th. As the longest-running primetime scripted series on television, The Simpsons has produced hundreds of characters, each with a different voice — but not necessarily a different actor. That's because each of the principal actors on the show voice multiple characters, in some cases dozens of them.

In Cuba there is barely any internet. Anything but the state-run TV channels is prohibited. Publications are limited to the state-approved newspapers and magazines. This is the law. But, in typical Cuban fashion, the law doesn't stop a vast underground system of entertainment and news media distributors and consumers.

""El Paquete Semanal"" (The Weekly Package) is a weekly trove of digital content—everything from American movies to PDFs of Spanish newspapers—that is gathered, organized and transferred by a human web of runners and dealers to the entire country. It is a prodigious and profitable operation.

I went behind the scenes in Havana to film how the Paquete works. Check out the video above to see how Cubans bypass censorship to access the media we take for granted.

d16LNHIEJzs,Vox,UCLXo7UDZvByw2ixzpQCufnA,Color film was built for white people. Here's what it did to dark skin.,2015-09-18 14:56:50+00:00,"The unfortunate history of racial bias in photography.

Subscribe today: http://goo.gl/0bsAjO

For decades, the color film available to consumers was built for white people. The chemicals coating the film simply weren't adequate to capture a diversity of darker skin tones. And the photo labs established in the 1940s and 50s even used an image of a white woman, called a Shirley card, to calibrate the colors for printing. 

Concordia University professor Lorna Roth has researched the evolution of skin tone imaging. She explained in a 2009 paper how the older technology distorted the appearance of black subjects:

""Problems for the African-American community, for example, have included reproduction of facial images without details, lighting challenges, and ashen-looking facial skin colours contrasted strikingly with the whites of eyes and teeth.""

How this would affect non-white people seemingly didn't occur to those who designed and operated the photo systems. In an essay for Buzzfeed, writer and photographer Syreeta McFadden described growing up with film that couldn't record her actual appearance:

""The inconsistencies were so glaring that for a while, I thought it was impossible to get a decent picture of me that captured my likeness. I began to retreat from situations involving group photos. And sure, many of us are fickle about what makes a good portrait. But it seemed the technology was stacked against me. I only knew, though I didn’t understand why, that the lighter you were, the more likely it was that the camera — the film — got your likeness right.""

Many of the technological biases have since been corrected (though, not all of them, as explained in the video above). Still, we often see controversies about the misrepresentation of non-white subjects in magazines and advertisements. What are we to make of the fact that these images routinely lighten the skin of women of color?

Tools are only as good as the people who use them. The learned preference for lighter skin is ubiquitous in many parts of the world, and it starts early. That's an infinitely tougher problem than improving the color range of photo technology.

Eleven US states have either passed laws or amended the Common Core curriculum to require teachers to cover cursive handwriting in elementary schools. This came in response to the Common Core standards, released in 2010, which require keyboarding skills, but do not mention handwriting or cursive specifically. Advocates for cursive instruction worry that kids will not be able to read founding documents like the Constitution or the Declaration of Independence if they don't learn cursive. But it appears that they are fighting the inevitable.

These statutes dictate specific prison terms for certain crimes deemed uniquely harmful to society. By design, they bar judges from using discretion during sentencing. Minimums have been around since America’s founding, but the most consequential ones were erected in the 1980s in response to the ravages of the inner-city drug trade. The idea was to establish uniformly stringent punishments to both deter drug offenses and lock away kingpins. And a central feature of this framework was the now infamous minimum sentencing disparity between crack and powder cocaine violations.


The US government created a 100-to-1 minimum sentence disparity between crack and powder cocaine.

In the US, crack consumption is tied to income, and income is tied to race. So this arbitrary sentencing disparity has forced courts to punish black Americans much more harshly than white Americans for basically the exact same crime. As a result, tens of thousands of young men, most of whom are black, have been snatched up by law enforcement on low-level drug offenses and thrown into prison for mandatory terms that make a mockery of any sense of proportionately. This situation is so absurd that its sparked the formation of a reform coalition composed of the most unlikely of allies, including the Koch brothers, the NAACP, Newt Gingrich, the ACLU, Senator Rand Paul, and the Obama White House.

Fortunately, policymakers have started injecting some common sense into the minimums regime. A landmark 2005 Supreme Court decision afforded federal judges some leeway to stray from dictated terms. A major federal criminal justice package passed in 2010 eliminated minimums for simple crack possession and dramatically ratcheted back the crack-powder sentencing disparity from 100-to-1 to 18-to-1. And President Obama recently wielded the executive commutation power to pardon 46 people serving excessive mandatory terms for nonviolent drug offenses. But there's a still a long way for the US to go to make sentencing fair.

Subscribe to our channel! http://goo.gl/0bsAjO

In seven states in the US, there are laws that criminalize shooting or possessing video of an agricultural facility without the owner’s permission. The food industry wants to keep farms private — but given that similar anti-whistleblower bills have failed in most states and have earned overwhelmingly negative press, it appears that the public doesn’t entirely agree.

When activist organizations do these undercover investigations, they can often reveal shocking employee behavior on farms — but they can also reveal perfectly legal, standard industry practices that the public doesn’t know about. 

And with a population increasingly uninvolved with food production, there’s a lot that we don’t know about how our food is made.

Food in America is unique: we spend less on food in the US than any other country, only 6.5 percent. 

It’s hard to say whether anti-whistleblower laws will last long — just this summer, a federal judge overturned Idaho’s law, ruling that it was an unconstitutional violation of the right to free speech. The food industry is trying to figure out a way to strike a balance between transparency and business interests, and it's a balance that's still very much in the works.

Interviews by The Lower Ninth Ward Living Museum http://l9livingmuseum.org/
and Estelle Caswell

Ten years ago, Hurricane Katrina hit the Gulf Coast, bringing with it an immense storm surge and winds over 120 miles per hour.

The massive eyewall of the storm directly hit the Mississippi coast where Leonard Papania, a police officer and resident, immediately began search and rescue.

Sixty miles west, the natural disaster turned into a manmade catastrophe when the levee system protecting New Orleans broke down, covering 80 percent of the city in at least 10 feet of water. Called the worst engineering failure in US history, the flooding killed hundreds of people and rendered hundreds of thousands homeless.

The Lower Ninth Ward neighborhood was one of the worst-hit parts of the city — only one in five of its residents have returned. Following the disaster, the Lower Ninth Ward Living Museum collected oral histories about Hurricane Katrina from residents of the neighborhood. The video above paints a picture of what survivors across the Gulf Coast experienced during the storm and its aftermath.

In the 1990s and early 2000s, meth became the most widely used illicit drug among urban gay men. ""Early characterizations of the meth problem in the gay community depicted the party boy or the middle-class white man as the prototype of the meth user,"" says Dr. Perry Halkitis, professor of applied psychology, global public health, and medicine at New York University.

Public health campaigns in the early 2000s targeted white gay meth users as a way of combating the AIDS epidemic. This, Halkitis believes, created a stigma among middle- and upper-class white gay men and pushed the drug underground in the gay community. And while Halkitis says meth use is still common among all subsets of the gay population, a recent study of his found meth now disproportionately affects HIV-positive and African-American gay men.

To make this short, filmmaker Spencer Macnaughton spent weeks of chatting online with many men and attending a Crystal Meth Anonymous meeting at New York's LGBT Community Center, where 38 gay male ex-meth users shared their recovery stories. For more on how this was made, see the article on Vox.com: http://www.vox.com/2015/8/24/9196953/meth-unseen-face-pnp

Asian flush, also widely known as Asian glow, is when Chinese, Japanese and Korean people turn red after drinking alcohol. What causes Asian glow? Genetics, basically. Around 36% of Northeast Asians are deficient in one of the enzymes that metabolizes alcohol, due to a gene mutation called ALDH2*2. This leads to a buildup of a toxic substance called acetaldehyde, which causes Asian flush and can also cause cancer, especially esophageal cancer.

Don't miss Vox's Game of Thrones coverage: https://www.vox.com/game-of-thrones

Subscribe to our channel! http://goo.gl/0bsAjO

The White Walkers are some of Thrones’ creepiest villains — but they also help tell a really interesting metaphor about climate change.

For starters, the White Walkers are a threat to all humanity: Their zombie minions are equally happy to rip apart people of all nations and noble houses. Yet instead of uniting to combat the shared threat to human existence, the houses in the show spend basically all their time on their own petty disagreements and struggle for power. White Walkers are generally ignored; some nobles deny their existence outright.

Swap climate change for White Walkers and ""countries"" for noble houses, and it starts to sound a lot like the real world.

Specifically, it sounds like the problem of international coordination on climate change. No one country can prevent catastrophic warming on its own: Every country that's a major greenhouse gas emitter is part of the problem.

UPDATE: Watch our 2020 follow-up interview with Gates: https://youtu.be/jLbJayQygzw

There's something out there that's as bad as war, something that kills as many people as war, and Bill Gates doesn't think we're ready for it.

""Look at the death chart of the 20th century,"" he says, because he's the kind of guy that looks at death charts. ""I think everybody would say there must be a spike for World War I. Sure enough, there it is, like 25 million. And there must be a big spike for World War II, and there it is, it's like 65 million. But then you'll see this other spike that is as large as World War II right after World War I, and most people, would say, 'What was that?'""

""Well, that was the Spanish flu.""

In a 1990 paper on ""The Anthropology of Infectious Disease,"" Marcia Inhorn and Peter Brown estimated that infectious diseases ""have likely claimed more lives than all wars, noninfectious diseases, and natural disasters put together."" 

Infectious diseases are our oldest, deadliest foe.

And they remain so today. ""In a good year, flu kills over 10,000 Americans,"" says Dr. Thomas Frieden, director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. ""In a bad year, it kills over five times that. If we have a pandemic, it will be much worse. People think the H1N1 flu wasn’t so bad. But more than 1,000 American kids died from H1N1!""

gU8rQWh_qtc,Vox,UCLXo7UDZvByw2ixzpQCufnA,Why does the US have 800 military bases around the world?,2015-05-18 14:24:33+00:00,"It costs taxpayers billions to keep US bases around the globe running. Why are they there in the first place?

Subscribe to our channel! http://goo.gl/0bsAjO

The US has around 800 military bases in other countries, which costs an estimated $100 billion annually, a number that could be much higher depending on whether you count the bases still open in Iraq and Afghanistan. This is according to American University professor David Vine in his book Base Nation, in which he seeks to quantify the financial, environmental, and human costs of keeping these bases open.

The word ""base"" is a broad term that captures all sorts of military posts, stations, camps, forts, etc. around the globe. The Pentagon specifics that a ""base site"" is any geographic location that is ""owned by or leased to, or otherwise possessed"" by the military.

Most of these bases cropped up after World War II when the US took position as the global leader and peacekeeper in and around Japan and Germany. The Korean and Cold Wars sped up the expansion of US military infrastructure to other countries. Containing Soviet communism led the US to set up posts all over the globe to ensure a geopolitical foothold in places that were vulnerable to Soviet influence — which basically meant everywhere.

Even though Japan, Germany, and Korea are now American allies and stable democracies, thousands of troops and many bases still remain in these countries. Even though the Cold War is over, much of the military infrastructure built up in response to that era remains operational.

American taxpayers are in charge of the bill for keeping these bases running. This estimated $100 billion is pumped out of our economy to the location of these bases. It's a massive military system that ensures US influence in every corner of the planet, and given the uncontested nature of this widespread strategy, there isn't likely to be any change soon.

n3IYmdy6d4Y,Vox,UCLXo7UDZvByw2ixzpQCufnA,Here's what happens to your knuckles when you crack them,2015-03-09 13:19:18+00:00,"One man cracked his knuckles in one hand for 60 years and not the other. Watch the video to see what he found out.

There's a long-held myth that cracking your knuckles can damage your hands. The sound definitely might make people around you cringe, but what's making those noises, and is it actually bad for you?

There's a space in your joints filled with synovial fluid, a liquid that reduces the friction in your joints when you move. It contains gases (oxygen, nitrogen, and carbon dioxide).

When you pop a joint, you stretch out that space between the bones. That expanding space creates negative pressure, like a vacuum, that sucks in the synovial fluid. It forms bubbles, which then collapse, and that's what you hear.

Most medical sources agree that unless you experience pain when you pop your joints, you're probably fine to keep doing it. Researchers (including one man who cracked his knuckles on just one hand for 60 years) haven't established a connection between cracking your knuckles and arthritis.

One 1990 study of 300 people did find that cracking knuckles over a long period of time led to hand swelling and decreased grip strength, but there hasn't been any follow-up research on that.

--

Over 100 people have been treated for injuries from the earthquake in Napa, California, but no deaths were reported. Earthquakes are much, much more deadly in other parts of the world. Earlier this month, a 6.1-magnitude earthquake killed hundreds in Southwestern China. The video above explains why.

Here's the data on each earthquake from USGS:

The residents of Ferguson, Missouri, have taken to the streets to protest the shooting of 18-year-old Michael Brown, who was unarmed when he was killed by police on August 9. Demonstrations turned violent the day after Brown's shooting, with reports of looting in the area, but since then, protesters have remained largely peaceful. Nevertheless, police responded with military-grade equipment, tear gas, and rubber bullets. Vox's German Lopez explains how the response from law enforcement exacerbates long-standing tensions in this small St. Louis suburb.
